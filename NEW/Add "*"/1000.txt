     |C|          |A|m
1. Caught at a crossroad
        |F|               |G|
   Not knowing where to go;
   |C|        |G|/|B|
   So many plans,
            |A|m
   None to take my hand
       |D|m7                 |E|sus4-|E|7
   To lead me to the right road.
             |A|m
   Then Your message came,
      |E|/|G#|
   By two confirmed,
        |C|/|G|             |D|/|F#|
   That I should be set free.
           |D|m
   I don’t understand

   How could the Lord
                 |G|
    have need of me?

Chorus:
          |F|9       |C|sus4-|C|
   Here I am; send me.
         |F|             |C|/|E|
   I surrender all that I am;
      |D|m              |G|
   I lay me at Your feet.
         |G|/|F|    |F|
   I am Yours, Lord,
           |E|m - |A|m
   Now and evermore.
       |F|           |C|/|E|
   My life may not be much,
          |D|m                  |G|
   But I trust the Master’s touch;
    |D|m       |A|m7           |G|
   Take me, break me, and use me—
                    |C|
   Here am I, send me.

2. Though perplexed I followed,
   Yet deep down I felt peace;
   Some part of me
   Just couldn’t believe
   That I’d have something
    You’d need.
   Then we came to You,
   And there I found
   What I had long yearned for.
   All my questions gone,
   Just tell me how I can be Yours.

3. So much has happened;
   The rest is just a blur—
   Hosannas ring
   Praising Zion’s King.
   What revival He does stir!
   When all is said and done
   All that I want
   Is that Christ be glorified;
   I’ll just carry You
   And let me in Your presence hide.
