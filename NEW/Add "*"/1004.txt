  |A|             |D|maj7
1. One day when heaven
                          |A|
   Was filled with His praises,
               |D|maj7
   One day when sin was
                      |A|
   As black as could be,
              |D|maj7
   Jesus came forth to
                |A|
   Be born of a virgin—
              |D|maj7
   Dwelt among men, my
                |B|m
   Example is He.
                 |D|
   Word became flesh and

   The Light shined among us—
                  |E|
   His glory revealed.

Chorus:
               |A|
   Living, He loved me,
              |E|
   Dying, He saved me,
              |F#|m
   Buried, He carried
                 |D|
   My sins far away.
               |A|                  |E|
   Rising, He justified freely forever,
                |F#|m
   One day He’s coming—
               |D|                 |A|-|D|
   Oh glorious day! Oh glorious day!

Before Bridge Only:
            |A|-|E|
   Glorious day!

2. One day they led Him
   Up Calvary’s mountain;
   One day they nailed Him
   To die on a tree.
   Suffering anguish,
   Despised and rejected,
   Bearing our sins, my
   Redeemer is He.
   Hands that healed nations,
   Stretched out on a tree,
   And took the nails for me.

3. One day the grave could
   Conceal Him no longer;
   One day the stone
   Rolled away from the door.
   Then He arose,
   Over death He had conquered,
   Now He’s ascended,
   My Lord evermore.
   Death could not hold Him,
   The grave could not keep Him
   From rising again!

Bridge:
  |D|-             |A|
   One day the trumpet
            |E|           |F#|m
    will sound for His coming,
  |D|-            |A|
   One day the skies
               |E|           |C#|m
    with His glories will shine,
  |D|-          |A|
   Wonderful day,
          |E|         |F#|m
    my Beloved One bringing
  |D|-
   My Savior, Jesus is mine.
