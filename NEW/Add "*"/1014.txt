   That comes from where

2. We choose to walk
    this narrow road,
   For soon ‘twill be a street of gold.
   Though trials may come
    across our way,
   We gladly run on His highway.
   Our joy is that
    we’ve been redeemed,
   So on we go towards
    glory’s stream.
   So on we go towards
    glory’s stream.

3. Our labors here are not in vain,
   Though oft’ it seems
    the prize is pain.
   But man’s applause is not our aim;
   We’re only longing for that day
   When Jesus gathers all His saints,
   And with this hope
    we will not faint.
   And with this hope
    we will not faint.
