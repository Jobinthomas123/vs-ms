             |A|            |D|/|A|  |A|
1. When the Lord has built up Zion,
            |D|            |A|
   In His glory He’ll appear.
          |C#|            |F#|m
   Then upon that holy mount

    will stand,
              |D|
   Those who followed
                 |E|
    Christ the Lamb.

Chorus:
        |A|
   Oh, Zion,
        |C#|m
   What glorious things
    |D|                  |A|
    we have heard of thee.
      |D|m          |A|/|C#|
   Perfection of beauty,
       |B|m              |D|/|E|      |E|
   The joy of all the earth is she!
        |A|
   From Zion
        |C#|m
    our God does shine;
    |D|                |A|
   What a glorious sight!
   |D|m                   |A|/|C#|
   And that light will guide us ‘til
         |B|m      |E|      |A|
    we stand on Zion’s hill.

2. How I love to sing of Zion;
   It is my inheritance.
   Though her stones
    may be despised by some;
   They are precious truths I love.

3. Nothing else compares to Zion;
   See the beauty of the King!
   And all other beauties fade away
   In the light of Jesus’ face.

4. How our God does fight for Zion,
   For He loves His heritage.
   And He said
    He won’t forsake His own
   ‘Til they reach
    their heav’nly home.

5. Soon the ransomed
    will come to Zion—
   Crowns of joy upon their heads.
   They will sing the anthems
    none can sing,
   Bringing glory to their King!
