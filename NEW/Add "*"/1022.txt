   O my soul,

   Worship His holy name.

1. The sun comes up;
          |A|       |B|m
   It’s a new day dawning.
 |G|-              |D|         |A|     |B|m
   It’s time to sing Your song again.
       |G|         |D|
   Whatever may pass,
          |A|/|C#|          |B|m
   And whatever lies before me–
 |G|-           |D|
   Let me be singing
            |A|sus4-|A|  |D|
   When the evening comes.

2. You’re rich in love,
   And You’re slow to anger.
   Your name is great,
   And Your heart is kind.
   For all Your goodness
   I will keep on singing–
   Ten thousand reasons
   For my heart to find.

3. And on that day
   When my strength is failing,
   The end draws near
   And my time has come,
   Still my soul
   Will sing Your praise unending–
   Ten thousand years
   And then forevermore.
