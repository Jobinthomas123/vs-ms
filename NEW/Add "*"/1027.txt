    me through.

1. Lord, You said if I would follow,
                      |A|/|C#|
   I must take up my cross;
                          |B|/|D#|
   For the trials would refine me,
                         |F#|m7-|B|
   To make me pure from dross.

2. When rejected, I’ll remember
   Your Father turned His face.
   In the darkest hour You
    triumphed;
   You tasted death by grace.

3. Though your paths go through
    the valley
   Of death’s dark corridor,
   Death can only cast a shadow;
   Your light has gone before.

4. Oh I long to see the glory
   When trials fade away.
   You will say,
    “Well done, beloved.”
   I’m living for that day.

Bridge:
             -|B|      -|A|
   I will wait on You;
   |F#|m                         -|B|sus4
   Lord, You’ll bring me through.
             -|B|      -|A|/|C#|
   I will wait on You;
   |F#|m                          -|B|sus4
   Lord, You’ll bring me through.
