1. There is a hope
          |D|m       |C|/|E|    |F|2
    that burns within my heart,
        |D|m7/|F|-|C|/|E| |D|m7
   That gives me strength
         |C|/|E|     |F|2     |G|sus4-|G|
    for ev’ry   passing day;
      |F|/|A|    |G|/|B|  |C|
   A glimpse of glory
     |D|m   |C|/|E|       |F|2-|G|   |A|m7
    now revealed in meager part,
        |C|/|E|       |D|sus4-|D| |G|sus4-|G|
   Yet drives all doubt   away.
      |A|m7      |E|m/|G|
   I stand in Christ,
          |F|    |G|/|F|  |C|/|E|
    with sins forgiv’n;
        |D|m7      |E|/|G#|
   And Christ in me,
        |A|m7 - |G|/|B| - |C|
    the hope  of   heav’n!
   |D|m    |C|/|E|    |F|2
   My  highest calling
           |C|/|G|-|E|/|G#|-|A|m7
   and my deepest   joy–
   |F|  |C|/|G|       |G|      |C|sus4-|C|2
   To make His will my home.

2. There is a hope
    that lifts my weary head,
   A consolation strong against despair,
    That when the world
   has plunged me in its deepest pit,
    I find the Savior there!
   Through present sufferings,
    future's fear,
   He whispers, “Courage,”
    in my ear.
   For I am safe in everlasting arms,
   And they will lead me home.

3. There is a hope
    that stands the test of time,
   That lifts my eyes
    beyond the beck’ning grave,
   To see the matchless
    beauty of a day divine
   When I behold His face!
   When sufferings cease
    and sorrows die,
   And every longing satisfied,
   Then joy unspeakable will flood
    my soul,
   For I am truly home.
