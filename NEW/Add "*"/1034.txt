2. You have said,
   “Be still and know I’m God;
   Wait for Me
   To show My pow’r to you.
   I will do all that
    I’ve promised you;
   Place your faith and trust in Me.”
   Yes...

3. When life’s trials
   They seem to bring me down,
   And in times
   I can’t see through the night.
   I will sing a song of victory,
   For I trust the King of kings.
   Yes...
