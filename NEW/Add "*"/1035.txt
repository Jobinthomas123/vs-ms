1. My God,
         |F|             |C|/|E|
   As I wait upon Your will,
           |F|             |C|
   You've told me to be still
        |F|                |G|sus4-|G|
   And hold on with expectation.
       |A|m
   My Lord,
         |F|           |C|/|E|
   Your Word is my strength;
       |F|                  |C|
   It lifts me when I'm faint
           |F|              |G|sus4-|G|
   In the depths of tribulation.

Chorus:
           |F|           |C|
   As You hold up the heavens,
           |G|-|E|/|G#|--|A|m
   You're holding me
            |F|
   By Your right hand
        |C|        |G|sus4-|G|
    of power and might.
         |F|             |C|
   As I look to Your presence
           |G|   |E|/|G#|   |A|m
   I will sing Your praise;
               |F|
   And through all
             |G|    |C|sus4-|C|
   You will be my Light.

2. My Love,
   As I wait, I will serve You;
   I'll do all You want me to
   With a fire and a passion.
   My Light,
   Please show Your love
    through me,
   So that all the world may see
   Your grace and Your salvation.
