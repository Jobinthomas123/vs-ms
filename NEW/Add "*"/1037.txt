              |A|
1. They were gathered
                  |A|7
    in an upper chamber
          |D|                   |A|
   As commanded by the risen Lord;
            |E|7             |A|
   And the promise of the Father
                |B|7
   There they sought
                |E|7
    with one accord,
             |A|
   When the Holy Ghost
                    |A|7
    from heav’n descended
          |D|
   Like a rushing wind
                   |C#|7
    and tongues of fire.
             |D|
   So, dear Lord,
        |D|m       |A|
    we seek Thy blessing;
    |F#|m–|F|dim–|A|/|E|
   Come with glory
             |E|7        |A|
    now our hearts inspire.

Chorus:
            |A|                 |A|7
   Let the fire fall! Let the fire fall!
            |D|                |A|
   Let the fire from heaven fall!
          |E|7             |A|
   We are waiting and expecting,
           |B|7                  |E|7
   Now in faith, dear Lord, we call.
           |A|                  |A|7
   Let the fire fall! let the fire fall!
            |D|           |C#|7
   On Thy promise we depend.
              |D|           |A|
   From the glory of Thy presence,
  |F#|m-|F|dim-|A|/|E|         |E|7       |A|
   Let the Pentecostal fire descend.

2. As Elijah we would raise the altar
   For our testimony clear and true;
   Christ the Savior, loving Healer,
   Coming Lord, Baptizer too.
   Ever flowing grace
    and full salvation,
   For a ruined race
    Thy love has planned;
   For this blessed revelation,
   For Thy written word
    we dare to stand.

3. 'Tis the covenanted promise given
   To as many as the Lord shall call–
   To the fathers, and their children,
   To Thy people, one and all.
   So rejoicing in Thy word
    unfailing,
   We draw nigh in faith
    Thy power to know.
   Come, O come,
    Thou burning Spirit,
   Set our hearts with
    heavenly fire aglow.

4. With a living coal
    from off Thy altar,
   Touch our lips
    to swell Thy wondrous praise–
   To extol Thee, bless, adore Thee,
   And our songs of worship raise.
   Let the cloud of glory
    now descending
   Fill our hearts with holy ecstasy.
   Come in all Thy glorious fullness,
   Blessed Holy Spirit,
    have Thy way.
