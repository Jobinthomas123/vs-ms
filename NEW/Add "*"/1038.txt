(Key of |C|)
                   |A|m7
1. Deep within my heart I feel
                    |D|m7
   A melody that’s rising–
                    |A|m7
   Whispers from my home above
                      |G|sus4-|G|
   Where holy angels shine.
                |A|m7
   Heaven is a place
                           |D|m7
   Where all forever is surprising;
        |F|         |G|
   And God is my God,
           |A|m
   Forever mine.
        |D|m               |A|m
   The hours are passing by;
                             |D|m7
   I see the world fade into darkness.
                |A|m7
   People all around are charmed
                     |G|sus4-|G|
   By dangers of the night.
                         |A|m7
   But I will leave the shadows,

   And I’ll walk
                 |D|m7
    in paths of brightness;
       |F|           |G|
   My Savior leads me
                 |A|m7
    to gates of light.

Chorus:
            |F|maj7         |G|
   ‘Til that day I’ll be kept
            |C|           |A|m
   In the shade of Your hand;
          |F|maj7           |G|
   By the pow’r of Your grace,
           |C|         |A|m
   I will evil withstand.
             |F|         |D|m
   With no fear of the foe,
          |E|m-|A|m-  |D|m
   I can joyfully sing;
       |F|maj7         |D|m
   I am safe in the shelter
       |F|  |F|/|G|        |C|
    of El Shaddai’s wings.

2. So I will never fear to face
   The trials of tomorrow;
   My God will never leave me
   Even in the midst of fire.
   I will never let my burdens
   Tie me down in sorrow;
   My anchor is Christ–
   My one desire.
   Jesus, keep me close to You
   These dark and final moments;
   Give me strength to reach the end–
   This race I have to run.
   Someday I will stand with You
   In white and spotless garments,
   Then heaven will shout,
   “The cross has won!”
