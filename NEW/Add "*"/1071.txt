Chorus:
              |E|
   He said, “Come,
    |A|          |E|/|G#|
   Anyone who wants
          |C#|m
    must deny himself,
     |A|           |B|           |E| – |E|/|G#|
   Take up his cross, follow Me;
       |A|          |C#|m
   No matter the cost
           |A|         |B|
   Be my heart, my hands,
         |A|
    my voice.”

    |E|          |E|sus4        |E|
1. How are we living for Christ?
   |E|/|G#|        |A|           |B|
   How are we living for Christ?
     |C#|m      |B|           |A|    |E|/|G#|
   Following Him we will sacrifice
   |F#|m                    |B|
   But are we willing to die?

2. God gives the strength that it takes
   And He knows the price
    that you pay.
   The life you’ve been called to
    will not be in vain;
   So don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid.

3. When you are shackled in chains,
   Imprisoned for sharing His name
   If you should suffer
    for righteousness’ sake
   Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid.

2nd Chorus:
   (He said) Come,
   Anyone who wants deny yourself,
   Take up your cross, follow me;
   No matter the cost
   Be my heart, my hands, my voice.
