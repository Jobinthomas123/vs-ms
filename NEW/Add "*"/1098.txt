              |C|
1. I’ve lost count of all the times
               |E|m -
    I’ve fallen short,
           |F|
   But You always pick me up
         |A|m           |G|sus4-G
    and tell me to move forward.
              |C|
   When I’ve lost the strength to fight
                  |E|m -
    this fight for   You,
          |F|
   You remind me through
               |C|/|G|           |G|sus4 - |G|
    Your power, I can do all things.

Chorus:
                  |C|        |E|m
   Your name is faithful, eternal,
      |F|
    merciful and kind.
                |G|sus4     |G|/|B|
   Your name is loving, gracious—
       |F|m6/|C|               |C| - |E|
    it stands the test of time.
       |A|m              |E|m
   When I have called upon Your
     |A|m         |D|m
    name, I’ve never had to fear.
         |F|/|G|      |G|
   I can always trust, Lord, in
   |C| -
    Your name.

2. When the waves of sin and doubt
    – they cover me,
   I kneel down at Your throne,
    and I lay it all before You.
   When the enemy comes at me
    from all sides,
   I call the only name,
    I know that I can trust.

Bridge:
    |C|   |C|/|E|     |F|- |G|
   Your name is holy,
   |C|/|E|               |G| - |A|m - |G|/|B|
   Your name brings liberty;
   |C|/|E|            |F|/|A|     |G|sus4 - |G|
   Your name sets my soul free,
   |C|/|E|          |F|/|G| - |C|
   Your name is victory.
