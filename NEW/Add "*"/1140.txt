1. There is strength
                |D|
    within the sorrow;

   There is beauty in our tears.
|F#|m–
   And You meet us
              |D|
    in our mourning
 |E|–                            |A|
   With a love that casts out fear.

   Sanctifying us,

   You’re teaching us to trust.

Chorus:
          |D|                  |A|
   Your plans are still to prosper,

   You’ve not forgotten us,
           |D|              |A|
   You’re with us in the fire
              |E|
    and the flood.

3. You are wisdom unimagined;
   Who could understand Your ways?
   Reigning high above the heavens,
   Reaching down in endless grace.

   Compassionate and kind;
   You surround and You uphold me,
   And Your promises are my delight.
