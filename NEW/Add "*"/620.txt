  |E|                 |A|
O Lord, You are my Refuge and
    |E|
 Strength;
                     |A|        |B|
I run to You and I know I am safe.
              |A|           |E|
Youâ€™re everywhere all the time.
             |A|             |E|
You hear my voice when I cry,
        |E|          |C|#m     |A|
And You run to my rescue again
 |B|     |E|
 and again.
