|E|  |A|               |B|
I come to do Your will,
         |E| – |C#|m
 oh, my God.
      |A|             |B|
Your law is written on
     |E| – |C#|m
 my heart.
       |A|          |B|
You’ve opened my ears;
      |E|          |C#|m
Your call I now hear.
   |A|               |B|
I come to do Your will,
         |E|
 oh, my God.

Spirit, soul and body I give.
Only for Your glory I’ll live.
Be it gain or loss,
Be it crown or cross,
I come to do Your will,
 oh, my God.
