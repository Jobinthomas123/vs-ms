1. My Jesus, I love Thee;
        |E|m   |A|       |D|
    I know Thou art mine.
            |G|        |D|   |B|m
   For thee all the pleasures
        |E|m  |A|   |D|
    of sin  I resign.

   My gracious Redeemer,
       |D|  |G|         |A| —|A|7
    my Savior art Thou;
     |D|  |G|     |D|      |B|m
   If ever I loved Thee,
        |E|m-|A|        |D|
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!

2. I love Thee because
   Thou has first loved me,
   And purchased my pardon
    on Calvary’s tree;
   I love Thee for wearing
    the thorns on Thy brow.
   If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!

3. I’ll love Thee in life;
   I will love Thee in death,
   And praise Thee as long as Thou
    lendest me breath.
   And say, should the death-dew
    lie cold on my brow,
   If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!

4. In mansions of glory
   And endless delight,
   I’ll ever adore Thee
    in heaven so bright;
   I’ll sing with the glittering
    crown on my brow.
   If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!
