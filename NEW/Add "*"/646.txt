1. With my whole heart
            |A|m
    I will seek You;
 |D|                          |G|
   Use my life, O Lord, I pray.
 |G|               |E|m
   I yield my stubborn will
         |A|m
    completely;
 A
   May Your commandments light
        |D|
    my way.

 |G|                    |C|
2. My life, Lord, is Yours to control;
 |D|                |C|            |G|
   I give You my heart and my soul.
  |E|m                      |A|m
   I’ll seek Your will, never mine,
 |D|                    |G|
   Rich treasures to find.

 |G|                  |C|
3. Give wisdom to choices I make
 |D|              |C|           |G|
   Along every path that I take,
  |E|m                |A|m
   For when I complete life’s race,
  |D|                       |G|
   “Well done,” You will say.
