  These are the days of visitation;
|D|                             |E|m
  These are the days of restoration.
      |A|m
  The Lord is sending,
        |E|m
   is sending the rain;
      |C|         |D|        |E|m
  Behold, He is coming again.

   |A|m
  Send down the rain,
    |E|m
  Pour out Your Spirit,
   |D|                    |E|m
  Come and revive us again;
   |A|m          |E|m
  Make us a flame, a flame of fire,
   |C|                |D|      |E|m
  Burning till You come again.
