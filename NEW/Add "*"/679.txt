1. O Jesus, I have promised
       |F|          |G| |G|7  |C|
   To serve Thee to the end;
        |C|    |C|7/|E|  |F|    |D|m
   Be Thou forever near me,
       |G|     |C|       |G|-|G|7
   My Master and my Friend.
       |C|                 |F|   |C|
   I shall not fear the battle
        |C|        |C|7/|E| |F|-|D|m
   If Thou art by my side,
        |C|               |G|   |G|7
   Nor wander from the pathway
        |F|        |G| |G|7  |C|
   If Thou wilt be my Guide.

2. Oh, let me feel Thee near me;
   The world is ever near.
   I see the sights that dazzle;
   The tempting sounds I hear.
   My foes are ever near me—
   Around me and within;
   But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
   And shield my soul from sin.

3. Oh, let me hear Thee speaking
   In accents clear and still,
   Above the storms of passion,
   The murmurs of self-will.
   Oh, speak to reassure me,
   To hasten or control;
   Oh, speak and make me listen,
   Thou Guardian of my soul.

4. O Jesus, Thou hast promised
   To all who follow Thee,
   That where Thou art in glory
   There shall Thy servants be.
   And Jesus, I have promised
   To serve Thee to the end;
   Oh, give me grace to follow
   My Master and my Friend.

5. Oh, let me see Thy footprints,
   And in them plant my own;
   My hope to follow fully
   Is in Thy strength alone.
   Oh, guide me, call me, draw me,
   Uphold me to the end;
   And then in heav’n receive me,
   My Savior and my Friend.
