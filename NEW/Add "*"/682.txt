1. He healeth me — O blessed truth.
        |C|      |A|m     |C|
   His mighty Word renews
        |G|7
    my youth.
       |C|       |C|7
   By His own power,
          |F|         |D|m
    from sickness free,
        |C|       |A|m     |C|  |G|    |C|
   My precious Savior healeth me.

Chorus:
       |C|      |G|
   He healeth me.

2. Sometimes through testing
    times I go,
   Dark seems the way,
    and full of woe;
   But in the furnace though I be,
   My great Physician healeth me.

3. Lord, I would spread this
    truth abroad—
   The mighty power of Thy Word;
   It’s just the same,
    the blind now see,
   And demons at Thy presence flee.

4. For sin and sickness doth depart,
   When Thou dost reign
    within the heart;
   And I from all the curse am free,
   Since Christ, my Savior,
    healeth me.
