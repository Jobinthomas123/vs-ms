Chorus:
   x2
   |D|                |G|          |A|
   And, you shall search for Me,
                 |D|      |B|m
   And you shall find Me
                   |E|m          |A|
   When you shall search for Me
        |A|7
   With all your heart and soul. x2

   |A|               |D|4
1. Come, let us return
            |D|
    to the Lord,
  |A|
   And turn from our
     |D|4   |D|
    wicked ways;

  x2
  |G|                |D|
   For He will forgive our sins
  |A|                     |D|
   And restore us once again. x2

2. Come, let us seek our God,
   While He may yet be found,

   x2
   And call on His holy name,
   While His presence is still near. x2
