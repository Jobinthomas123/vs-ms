1. When I survey
    |A|-|B|  |E|m   |A|7   |D|
    the wondrous cross,
                  |D|4   |D|    |B|m   |A|
   On which the Prince of glory died,
   |D|              |A|-|B| |E|m    |A|7   |D|
   My richest gain I count but loss,
    |B|m          |F#|m
   And pour contempt
    |B|m   |E|m    |A|7    |D|
    on   all   my pride.

2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
   Save in the death of Christ
    my God;
   All the vain things that charm
    me most,
   I sacrifice them to His blood.

3. See, from His head,
    His hands, His feet,
   Sorrow and love flow
    mingled down.
   Did eâ€™er such love
    and sorrow meet,
   Or thorns compose so rich
    a crown?

4. Were the whole realm of
    nature mine,
   That were a present far too small;
   Love so amazing, so divine,
   Demands my soul, my life, my all.
