   |D|          |D|6      |D|2
1. I see the signs announcing
           |G|      |E|m
    Thy appearing,
           |A|        |A|7
   And I yearn to meet
               |D|
    my loving Lord;
                |D|6      |D|2
   I know the crowning day is
              |G|      |E|m
    fast approaching,
           |A|      |A|7
   As foretold us in
                  |D|
    Thy precious Word.

Chorus:
          |G|      |E|m        A
   How I long to be like Thee,
           |D|  |B|m
    my Master!
          |D|       |B|m
   How I long to meet Thee
             |E|m - |A|
    face to face!
             |D|6        |A|m7
   Uphold me by Thy strength
          |D|7      |G|    |E|m
    and draw me closer;
             |A|
   Keep me ever at
    |A|7              |D|
    Thy throne of grace.

2. I do abhor this world of sin,
    my Savior,
   Nor its riches do I count as gain;
   For Thou wilt grant Thy child
    a throne forever,
   In Thy kingdom as Thy bride to reign.

3. Oh, keep me faithful in my
    consecration,
   Watchful, zealous,
    striving for the faith,
   Until a host from every tribe
    and nation
   Perfected, Thy coming shall await.

4. Arise, O saints, in light with
    armor gleaming,
   Steadfast to the end
    with courage stand;
   Oh, watch and pray and
    every day redeeming,
   Fight the battle bravely to the end.
