1. On the holy hill of Zion,
     |A|m     |F|maj7    |C|/|E|     |G|
   There behold the Lamb of God;
     |C|           |A|m
   Stands with Him
       |C|          |F|   |C|
    a host found worthy,
    |A|m       |C|/|E|     |G|       |C|
   True bondservants of our God.

Chorus:
    |C|     |F|          |D|m   |G|   |C|
   Oh, to be with Christ on Zion,
    |F|          |D|m      |G|        G|7
   Where transcendent glories shine.
    |C|           |A|m    |C|      |F|  |C|
   Called and chosen by the Savior,
     |A|m    |C|      |G|       |C|
   Privilege so great, divine!

2. Mercy sounds like harps on Zion;
   Fellowship with God is sweet.
   Seed once sown
    with tears now precious,
   Seated at His lowly feet.

3. None could learn that song of
    Zion,
   But the saints of highest heav’n,
   In the race, by steadfast courage,
   Won the prize by Jesus giv’n.

4. Firstfruits of the saved on Zion,
   What a choice of priceless worth.
   They before the
    throne found blameless
   By their faithfulness and birth.

5. Virgins undefiled on Zion—
   All the ancients stand amazed.
   They who followed Him in person,
   Have the Father’s name engraved.

6. These are they who
    reign from Zion—
   Serving God, behold His face.
   Seraphs hide with wings to
    worship,
   Who is worthy of that place?
