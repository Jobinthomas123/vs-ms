1. Once like a bird in prison I dwelt;
                |A|7     |E|     |A|  |E|
   No freedom from my sorrow I felt,
                                  |C#|m
   But Jesus came and listened to me,
         |E|       |C#|m   |F#|m-|A|    |E|
   And glory to God, He set  me free.

Chorus:
   |E|           |E|7
   He set me free one day;
    |A|         |F|3m7
    He set me free!
   |E|             |C#|m
   He broke the bars of
     |F#|         |B|
    prison for me!
    |E|          |E|7
   One day in glory
    |A|                |F#|m
    His face I shall see.
     |E|         |C#|m  |F#|m |B|       |E|
   Glory be to God! He set me free!

2. Now I am climbing
    higher each day;
   Darkness of night has drifted
    away.
   My feet are planted
    on higher ground,
   And glory to God,
    I’m homeward bound!

3. Goodbye to sin
    and things that confound;
   Naught of the world
    shall turn me around.
   Daily I’m working,
    I’m praying too,
   And glory to God,
    I’m going through!
