   Jesus—Lover of   my soul.

   Friends may fail me,
     |E|m    |A|
    foes assail me.
   |D|       |B|m      |E|m7  |A|   |D|
   He, my Savior, makes me whole.

Chorus:

   Hallelujah! What a Savior!
   |D|     |B|m     |E|m7     |A|
   Hallelujah! What a Friend!

   Saving, helping, keeping, loving—
    |D|     |G|   |E|m   |D|   |A|  |D|
   He is with me   to the end.

2. Jesus! What a strength in
    weakness!
   Let me hide myself  in  Him.
   Tempted, tried, and
    sometimes failing,
   He, my strength, my vict’ry wins.

3. Jesus! What a help in sorrow
   While the billows o’er me roll.
   Even when my heart is breaking,
   He, my comfort, helps my soul.

4. Jesus! What a Guide and Keeper
   While the tempest still is high.
   Storms about me,
    night o’ertakes me,
   He, my Pilot, hears my cry.

5. Jesus! I do now receive Him,
   More than all in Him I find;
   He hath granted me forgiveness;
   I am His, and He is mine.
