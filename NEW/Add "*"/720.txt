1. Floods of revival,
     |F|              |C|
    Lord, let them fall—
                  |A|m-|G|
   Streams of salvation
        |D|7       |G|
    reaching to all.
                  |C|
   Pour out Thy Spirit;
      |F|           |C|
    great is our need.
                   |F|—|D|m
   Sweep o’er our beings,
     |G|             |C|
    now while we plead.

Chorus:
             |C|       |F|          |C|
   Spirit divine, O quicken us now,
                  |F|—|D|m
   While in Thy presence,
     |D|7        |G|
    humbly we bow.
                |C|       |F|
   Set all our hearts ablaze
               |C|
    with Thy love;
                |F|—|D|m
   Teach us the secret of
     |G|          |C|
    life from above.

2. Utterly yielded, longing to know
   All the blest fullness
    love can bestow,
   Ready and willing, eager to give
   Perfect obedience, bravely to live.

3. Raise up a people, holy and free—
   Hearts with a vision
    like unto Thee,
   Souls that would rather
    die than give in—
   Lives with a passion,
    victory to win.

4. O for a deluge—
    Holy Ghost power;
   Lord, we are waiting,
    send it this hour.
   Open the windows
    of heav’n we pray;
   All on the altar
    gladly we lay.
