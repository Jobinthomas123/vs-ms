    trust in Thy name.

Chorus:
    |A|
   Jesus, I love Thee,
    |A|7       |D|     |B|m7
    O how I love Thee!
             |E|        |E|7       |A|
   Glory to God—from sin I am free!
                 |A|/|C#|
   Trusting Thy grace to
     |A|7       |D|   |B|m7
    keep me forever,

    live but for Thee.

2. Jesus, I love Thee,
    O how I love Thee!
   Yet ‘tis Thy grace that
    maketh it so;
   Nothing but grace so
    sweetly could move me,
   Giving my heart this
    heavenly glow.

3. Jesus, I love Thee,
    O how I love Thee—
   Love Thee because Thou
    first lovedst me.
   When on the cross my
    faith first beheld Thee
   Dying, from sin my
    soul to make free.

4. Jesus, I love Thee,
    O how I love Thee!
   How could I bear to
    live without Thee?
   Lord, I will trust Thee,
    follow and serve Thee;
   Keep me, O Savior,
    faithful to Thee.
