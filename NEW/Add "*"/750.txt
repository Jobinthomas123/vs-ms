Chorus:
            |D|m           |G|m        |D|m
   For His grace is sufficient for me,

   And His presence will meet
           |A|
    every need;
       |G|m           |D|m
   For by His power I will overcome.
             |B|b          |A|          |D|m
   Yes, His grace is sufficient for me.

         |D|m              |G|m
1. And though the battle rage
          |D|m
    all around me,
                                  |A|
   And there be fears within, without,
        |G|m                   |D|m
   His Spirit will surely uphold me;
        |B|b   |A|                 |D|m
   I’ll overcome all fear and doubt.

2. And when the enemy comes
    against me,
   And clouds and darkness
    fill my view,
   The Lord will surely deliver me;
   His power and love
    will see me through.

3. Though all the ones I love
    may forsake me,
   And there be none to lend
    their hand,
   The Lord will surely be near me,
   And by His grace I shall stand.

4. For God will perfect that which
    concerns me;
   All that He’s promised He’ll do.
   The Lord will surely complete
    in me
   The work that He started to do.
