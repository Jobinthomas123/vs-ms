 It’s not by power,
|A|m
  it’s not by might,
     |C|       |D|               |E|m
 But by my Spirit, says the Lord!

 Not with Your wisdom
   |A|m
  shall you now fight,
     |C|       |D|               |E|m
 But by My Spirit, says the Lord!

          |A|m
 For the Lord goes before you
       |E|m
  as a man of war,
      |B|
 Destroying every foe,
       |E|m          |E|
  your victory is sure!
       |A|m
 Be strong, and take courage,
 |E|m
  and fear no more,
           |C|      |D|
 For it’s by My Spirit,
            |E|m
  says the Lord!
