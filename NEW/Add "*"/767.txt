1. Send down Your pow’r,

   send down Your fire,
                               |B|
   Pour out Your Spirit on my soul!
   |F#|m         |B|
   With Your anointing
    |F#|m          |B|
    break every yoke;
    |F#|m       |B|
   Touch me, Lord,
                  |E|
    and make me whole.

2. Fill me with pow’r,
    fill me with fire,
   Send a great revival in my soul!
   Strengthen my heart
    with Your holy Word.
   O, Holy Spirit take control.

3. Come with Your pow’r;
    come with Your fire,
   For me You’ve won the victory!
   Break every chain
    in Your holy name;
   Jesus, come and set me free.
