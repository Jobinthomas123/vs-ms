1. Called unto holiness,
      |A|    |B|       |E|
    church of our God,
    |A|           |E|
   Purchase of Jesus,
       |F#|7            |B|
    redeemed by His blood;
    |E|              |C#|m
   Called from the world
            |B|          |E|
    and its idols to flee,
            |A|       |E|  |C#|m
   Called from the bondage
       |F#|m |B|       |E|
    of sin to be free.

Chorus:
     |E|        |B|7       |E|
   “Holiness unto the Lord”
    |A|       |E|        |B|7   |E|
    is our watchword and song.
     |A|       |C#|        |F#|m
   “Holiness unto the Lord”
                        |B|
    as we’re marching along—
    |E|         |A|        |E|        |A|
   Sing it, shout it, loud and long:
     |F#|m7               |E|
    “Holiness unto the Lord,”
              |B|7-|E|
   now and forever.

2. Called unto holiness,
    children of light,
   Walking with Jesus
    in garments of white;
   Raiment unsullied,
    nor tarnished with sin,
   God’s Holy Spirit abiding within.

3. Called unto holiness,
    praise His dear name,
   This blessed secret to
    faith now made plain;
   Not our own righteousness,
    but Christ’s within,
   Living and reigning and
    saving from sin.

4. Called unto holiness,
    glorious thought,
   Up from the wilderness
    wanderings brought,
   Out from the shadows
    and darkness of night
   Into the Canaan of perfect delight.

5. Called unto holiness,
    bride of the Lamb,
   Waiting the Bridegroom’s
    returning again!
   Lift up your heads
    for the day draweth near
   When in His beauty
    the King shall appear.
