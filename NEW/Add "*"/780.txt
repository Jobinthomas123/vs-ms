    when the Bridegroom comes?

4. It may be a time of sorrow
    when the Bridegroom comes,
   If our oil we hope to borrow

   Will our lamps be burning bright
    when the Bridegroom comes?

5. Oh, there’ll be a glorious meeting
    when the Bridegroom comes,
   And a hallelujah greeting
    when the Bridegroom comes.
   In the night, that solemn night,
   With our lamps be burning bright
    when the Bridegroom comes?
