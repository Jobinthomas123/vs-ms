   |G|
1. I was sinking deep in sin,
                       |D|7
    sinking to rise no more;
    |A|m             |D|
   Overwhelmed by guilt within,
    |A|m       |D|     |G|    |D|7
    mercy I did implore.
   |G|
   Then the Master of the sea
                         |C|   |A|m7
    heard my despairing cry.
      |C|       |C|m     |G|
   Christ my Savior lifted me;
     |C|   |D|   |D|7  |G|  |D|
    now safe am  I.

Chorus:
   x2
    |G|    |D|     |G| |C|
   Love lifted me!
    |G|            |C|  |E|7 |A|m
   Love lifted me!
   |C|            |D|7
   When no one but
    |G|
   Christ could help,
    |A|    (|D|7)  |D|7 (|G|)
   Love lifted me! x2

2. Souls in danger, look above,
    Jesus completely saves;
   He will lift you by His love
    out of the angry waves.
   Heâ€™s the Master of the sea;
    billows His will obey.
   He your Savior wants to be,
    be saved today!

3. When the waves of sorrow roll,
    when I am in distress,
   Jesus takes my hand in His,
    ever He loves to bless.
   He will every fear dispel,
    satisfy every need;
   All who heed His loving call,
    find rest indeed.
