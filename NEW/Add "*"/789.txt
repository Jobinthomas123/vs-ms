Follow You, I will follow You,
        |G|
Laying down my life as
    |F|    |D|m
 a sacrifice.
        |C|
Leaving all behind,
     |G|              |C|
 my life in You to find|.
    |G|                    |C|
My Jesus, I will follow You. (end)

       |F|         |G|
What things were gain to me
     |E|m              |A|m
I’ll gladly count as loss,
     |F|
That I may know Your sufferings
                        |G|
And the power of Your cross.
    |F|     |G|
To fellowship with You
    |E|                |A|m
Is my heart’s deep desire;
    |F|
And to this end
                   |G|4–|G|7
 I give my life to You.
