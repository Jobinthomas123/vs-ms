1. Be Thou my vision,
       |B|m    |A|/|C#| |D|
    O Lord of my heart;
   |A|          |E|m  |A|   |D|  |A|
   Nought be all else to me,
    |B|m    |A|   |D|    |A|
    save that Thou art—
   |G|              |D|
   Thou my best thought
       |B|m        |G|  |A|
    by day or by night,
   |D|           |B|m
   Waking or sleeping,
         |G|           |D|
    Thy presence my light.

2. Be Thou my Wisdom
    and Thou my true Word;
   I ever with Thee
    and Thou with me, Lord.
   Thou my great Father,
    I Thy true son;
   Thou in me dwelling, and
    I with Thee one.

3. Be Thou my battle-shield,
    sword for the fight;
   Be Thou my armor,
    be Thou my might.
   Thou my soul’s shelter,
    Thou my High Tower;
   Raise Thou me heavenward,
    O Power of my power.

4. Riches I heed not,
    nor man’s empty praise.
   Thou mine inheritance,
    now and always:
   Thou and Thou only,
    first in my heart,
   High King of heaven,
    my treasure Thou art.

5. High King of heaven,
    my victory won.
   May I reach heaven’s joys,
    O bright heaven’s Sun!
   Heart of my own heart,
    whatever befall,
   Still be my vision,
    O Ruler of all.
