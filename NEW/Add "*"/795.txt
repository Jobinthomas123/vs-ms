1. O, mighty cross—
               |E|m - |A|m

                |D|m
   The Lord of life
   |D|m/|C|             |G|4 - |G|
   Raised there to die.

Chorus:
       |G|/|E|  |F|   |G|        |E|m - |A|m
   His sacrifice  on Calvary
                |D|m       |C|/|E|
   Has made the mighty cross
     |F|        |G|       |C|
   A tree of life to me.

2. O, mighty cross—
   What throne of grace!
   He knew no sin,
   Yet took my place.

3. O mighty cross,
   O Christ so pure—
   Love held Him there,
   Such shame endured.

4. O, mighty cross—
   My soul’s release!
   The stripes He bore
   Have brought me peace.
