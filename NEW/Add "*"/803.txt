        |E|         |E|/|G#|
1. Disappointments
                |A|          |A|/|F#|
    are Thine appointments;
            |B|        |B|7     |E|    |E|7
   Lord, I take them all as such
               |A|               |E|/|G#|
   Just like clay in hands of  Potter,
           |F#|7           |B|     |B|7
   Yielded wholly to Thy touch.

Chorus:
   |E|
   Break me, melt me,
     |C#|m
    change me, Lord,
      |F#|m7        |B|
   To glorify Thy name.
    |E|       |B|/|D#|        |C#|m
   Just one touch from Thee,
      |C#|/|B|    |F#|m7         |B|
   And I will never be the same.
       |A|            |B|
   The glory of Thy countenance,
        |G#|m7           |C#|m
   The fullness of Thy love,
        |A|
   Will change me to
          |E|/|G#|
    Thine image, Lord,
        |F#|m7         |B|
   With glory from above—
   |B|7         |E|
   Change me, Lord!

2. All my life, now,
    is in Thy molding;
   Not a single choice is mine—
   Fully trusting, uncomplaining,
   Not my will, oh Lord, but Thine.

3. There are times when
    darkness deepens,
   Sorrows come across my way.
   But Your cross that I now carry
   Will be changed
    to crowns one day.

4. Take my body,
    soul, and spirit;
   Lord, I give myself to Thee.
   Doing Thy will is my pleasure
   Till Thy glorious face I see!
