      |E|m           |A|m
1. O holy Lamb of God—
          |C|      |B|m    |E|m
   Most precious sacrifice,
    |C|             |E|m
   Pure, perfect, sinless life,
         |D|                  |B|7
   The blood which will suffice,
    |A|m             |D|
   Who could have paid
              |E|m   — |C| — |D|
    a higher price?

Chorus:
  |E|m          |A|m  — |C|
   It was for me
          |D|         |E|m
   Those nails were driven.
  |E|m          |A|m  — |C|
   It was for me
            |D|          |E|m
   Cruel stripes were given.
  |B|7       |E|m  |B|7      |E|m
   All for me, all for me
        |C|    |D|   |E|m
   His side was riven.
    |B|7          |E|m
   What great price
       |B|7          |E|m
   He paid for my life—
       |C|       |D|    |E|m
   My sins to be forgiven.

2. The blood of bulls and goats
   Could not for sin atone;
   Great king from highest heav’n
   Must leave His glorious throne.
   He came to bear
    my sins alone.

3. He bore reproach and shame
   Upon dark Calvary’s tree—
   Bruised, mocked, despised of men,
   For all the world to see,
   Enduring all
    to set me free.

4. No greater love than this
   When Christ was crucified,
   Willingly He gave His life
   That we may be His bride,
   Forever, always
    by His side.
