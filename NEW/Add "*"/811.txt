1. Come, O Lord,
            |C|        |A|m
    and revive us again;
    |D|                    |G|
   Set all our hearts aflame,
              |G|7
   Set us on fire;
    |C|           |A|m
   That’s our desire.
    |D|             |D|7     |G|  — |G|7
   Send down the latter rain.

Chorus:
             |C|     |A|m7
   Send us a great revival,
           |G|    |E|m
   Lasting and eternal.
   |D|       |D|7/|F#|
   We want to see You
    |G|     |C|   |G|
    when You come;
        |G|7       |C|        |A|m7
   Make us all flames of fire,
                |G|         |E|m
   Filled with faith and power.
   |D|         |D|7/|F#| |G|
   We want to overcome.

2. Times of refreshing,
    oh yes, we are waiting.
   Restore the years we’ve lost;
   First love and power
   For this last hour,
   Lord, this is all we want.

3. This is the time of Your visitation;
   This is the final hour.
   Give us a vision
   For that convention
   High above in the sky.

4. Soon You are coming,
    oh what a rejoicing!
   At last, our race will be o’er;
   There no more crying,
   But joy everlasting,
   We’ll serve You evermore.
