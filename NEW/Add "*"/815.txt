       |A|      |A|7       |D|     |A|
1. We have a God Who changes not;
                  |F#|m7    |B|m  — |E|
   He’s still the same today,
        |A|     |A|7
   As when He walked and
      |D|         |A|
    showed His power
        |E|      |B|7      |E| — |E|7
   And wonders in His day.

Chorus:
       |A|      |F#|m
   Unchanging God,
         |B|m     |E|
    Foundation sure,
        |E|7             |A|  — |F#|m
   In Thee I’m truly blest;
     |B|m        |E|
   Unwav’ring, constant
      |A|         |F#|m
    Friend and Guide,
        |B|m     |E|         |A|    |D|     |A|
   In Thee in times of storm I’ll hide.
           |A|7        |D|    |B|m
   Forever will Thy love abide;
        |A|/|E|       |E|    |E|7  |A|
   In Thee I’ll trust and rest.

2. His Word forever will endure;
   Each promise will come true.
   If we just trust in Him alone,
   What He has said He’ll do.

3. Because our God will never
    change,
   His love will stay the same.
   His faithfulness will never end;
   His mercy still remains.

4. No matter if the gates of hell
   Against the truth assail,
   Our steadfast Rock,
    on Whom we stand,
   In victory will prevail.

5. The future is in His control;
   His counsel e’er will stand.
   Nothing can mar or disannul
   What God for us has planned.
