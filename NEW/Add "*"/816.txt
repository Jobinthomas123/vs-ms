1. He giveth more grace
             |A|m            |D|m7
   When the burdens grow greater;
       |G|              |G|7
   He sendeth more strength
             |F| |G|   |G|/|B| |C|   — |G|
   When the labors increase.
      |C|        |C|7
   To added affliction,
      |F|          |D|m7
   He addeth His mercy;
       |C|           |A|m
   To multiplied trials,
        |D|m  |C|/|G|   |G|     |C|
   His mul——ti——plied peace.

Chorus:
        |G|           |G|/|B|
   His love has no limit,
         |C|           |C|/|E|
   His grace has no measure,
        |F|            |D|m
   His power has no boundary
      |C|         |G|   — |G|7
    known unto men;
      |C|           |C|/|E|
   For out of His infinite
    |F|          |D|m
    riches in Jesus,
      |C|           |A|m
   He giveth, and giveth,
        |D|m  |C|/|G| |G|  |C|
    and gi——veth again!

2. When we have exhausted
   Our store of endurance,
   When our strength has failed
   Ere the day is half done,
   When we reach the end of our
   Hoarded resources,
   Our Father’s full giving
   Is only begun.
