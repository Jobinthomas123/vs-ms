Chorus:
     |G|               |D|
   Closer to You, O God—
             |D|4      |E|m
   Grant my heart’s desire:
    |B|7      |E|m     |B|7 – |A|m7    |E|m
   Perfect peace, sustaining grace,
    |C|       |D|    |D|4   |E|m
   Burning with holy fire.

     |C|             |D|
1. When storms of life
              |E|m
    around me rage,
    |C|               |B|7          |E|m
   Fierce battles threaten to engage,
         |B|7
   When faith is weak
        |A|m7
    and vision dim,
        |C|
   Then I must cling
          |D|4       |D|  -|D|/|F#|
    more close to Him.

2. When questions cloud
    the path I tread,
   Doubts would sway me
    from the goal ahead,
   When choices seem
    so hard to make,
   My Lord will show
    the way to take.

3. When hope gives way
    and fears abound,
   Barriers come in gaining
    higher ground,
   When losses hide
    the vict’ries won,
   I’ll lift my eyes unto the Son.
