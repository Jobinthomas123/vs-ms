1. How deep the Father’s
     |A|       |F#|m7
    love for us,
       |E|      |C#|m      |F#|m - |B|7
   How vast beyond all measure,
        |E|                  |A|    |F#|m7
   That He should give His only Son
        |E|    |C#|m           |B|-|E|
   To make a wretch His treasure.
         |E|
   How great the pain
         |A|     |F#|m
    of searing loss;
        |E|     |C#|m       |F#|m   |B|7
   The Father turns His face away
       |E|
   As wounds which mar
         |A|     |F#|m7
    the Chosen One
         |E|    |C#|m      |B|-|E|
   Bring many sons to glory.

2. Behold the Man upon a cross,
   My sin upon His shoulders;
   Ashamed,
    I hear my mocking voice
   Call out among the scoffers.
   It was my sin that held Him there
   Until it was accomplished.
   His dying breath
    has brought me life;
   I know that it is finished.

3. I will not boast in anything—
   No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
   But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
   His death and resurrection.
   Why should I gain
    from His reward?
   I cannot give an answer,
   But this I know with all my heart:
   His wounds have paid my ransom.
