Chorus:
  |D|                      |E|m
   Give me an undivided heart;
  |A|             |A|/|C#|
   Never let me from
                |D|
    Your love depart.

  |D|                          |E|m
1. On Calvary You gave Your life,

    Your all for me.
  |A|               |A|7
   You shed Your precious blood to
      |G|                   |D|
    cleanse and make me free,
  |B|m
   To heal my heart and soul
         |E|m7
    from all infirmity,
  |A|         |A|7              |D|
   So I may give my all to You.

2. Upon the cross were sin
    and sickness crucified;
   And by those cruel stripes
    and pierced, bleeding side,
   I now accept my healing—
    Lord, be glorified!
   I yield my body now to You.

3. You sent Your Holy Spirit
    from Your throne above
   To fill me with the nature
    of Your gentle Dove,
   That I may manifest
    the fullness of Your love;
   O Lord, please make me more
    like You.

4. I’m looking forward to that
    great and glorious day
   When You shall come to catch
    Your spotless bride away;
   Clothed in Your righteousness
    I’ll look to You and say,
   “Lord, all the glory goes to You!”

   (End of fourth verse)
