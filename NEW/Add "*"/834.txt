Chorus:
          |E|         |B|
   Great joy, great joy to the
    |E|          |B|        |A|
    ones who stand with God;
        |E|            |B|
   Great joy, great joy
      |E|                  |A|
    flooding through my soul.
              |E|        |B|
   Though the gates of hell
         |B|/|D#|        |C#|m
    come against my soul,
                      |A|
   With the saints of God
    |F#|m        |B|4 – |B|7
    I will prevail.
          |E|          |B|
   Great joy, great joy
      |A|         |B|       |E|
    flooding through my soul.

          |A|       |B|       |B|7     |E|
1. With promised joy for every trial,
          |E|   |B|-|B|7    |E|     —|E|7
   I’ll firmly take my stand;
        |A|      |B|
   For grace abounds
         |B|7    |C#|m
    and glory, too—
   |C#|m/|A|    |F#|m       |B|4  —|B|
   All from God’s own hand.

2. All through the day and
    through the night,
   With joy I’ve made my choice;
   In times of pain or suff’ring loss,
   It’s then I will rejoice.

3. I want to live above the world,
   With hope I’ve set  my eyes;
   And when He comes,
    I’ll go with Him
   To my home beyond the skies.
