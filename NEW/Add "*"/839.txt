       |A|            |D|
*1.* My soul shouts glory
            |A|
    to the Son of God
                      |F#|*m*        |B|*m* |E|
   For the work that grace hath done;
       |A|          |A|*7*
   My faith looks upward
             |D|       |B|*m7*
    with a steadfast eye
              |A|          |E|       |A|
   That is clear as the noonday sun.

*Chorus:*
         |E|*-*|E|*7*        |A|
   Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
                      |F#|*m*       |B|*m* |E|
   Hallelujah to the Savior I adore;
            |A|    |A|*7*
   I will praise Him.
            |D|    |B|*m7
   I will praise Him.
         |A|
   Hallelujah!
              |E|             |A|
    I will praise Him evermore.

2. My soul shouts glory
    to the Son of God;
   Not a cloud nor a care I see.
   My hope is clinging
    with a perfect trust
   To the cross He has borne for me.

3. My soul shouts glory
    to the Son of God;
   In His secret place I dwell.
   His constant presence
    overshades me there,
   And my joy there is none can tell.

4. My soul shouts glory
    to the Son of God,
   And I know it will not be long
   Till oâ€™er the river
    where the saints have gone,
   I shall join their eternal song.
