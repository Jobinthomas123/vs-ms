(Key of |C|)
            |E|m
1. From the time
                   |A|m
    that You first saved me,
            |D|m              |G|
   You have been so good to me.
             |E|m
   You have healed me,
                |A|m
    and You’ve filled me;
              |D|m             |G|
   You’ve supplied my every need.
                 |E|sus          |E|/|G#|
   Now I’ve been told that I can go
               |A|m               |D|7/|F#|
   Through the door and I’ll be free,
             |D|m7      |C|/|E|
   But in my heart I know
          |F|      |F|/|A|     |G|sus - |G|
    just where I want to be.

Chorus:
             |F|-|G|           |C|  |C|/|E|
   Pierce my ear at Your door,
                   |F|  |G|
   For I’m Your slave
                  |A|m  |G|/|B|  |C|
    and You’re my Lord.
          |F|  –|G|            |C|    |A|m
   Forever I’ll  obey Your voice.
               |F| |C|
   My Lord and Master,
      |D|m7        |G|    |A|m
    to serve You I rejoice;
          |D|m    |C|/|E|
   Forever I am Yours—
  |F|maj7    |G|        |C|
   I have made my choice.

2. You have fed me
    and You’ve clothed me
   With Your robe of righteousness;
   You’ve been a very present help
   When I called in my distress.
   With every spiritual gift in Christ,
   I know that I’ve been blessed.
   How could I ever think
    to give You any less?

3. I will live now for Your glory;
   In Your service I’ll be spent.
   Yes, I know there will be trials,
   But Your joy will be my strength.
   Though others have
    gone out the door,
   I’ll not go as they went;
   For at the door is where
    I made my covenant.
