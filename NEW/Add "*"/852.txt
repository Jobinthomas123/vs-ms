1. My heart rejoices at
         |E|             |A|
    the sound of Your appearing;
       |A|            |D|
   My soul rejoices in
          |E|                |A|
    the sweetness of Your voice.
          |D|
   Your grace has done
         |E|
    the final work;
         |C#|m7      |F#|m
   I’m ready to depart.

   Yes, come, O, Lord,
          |E|          |A|
    and satisfy my soul.

   Maranatha, Jesus,
          |A|        |A|7
    even come, O Lord!

   My heart is filled with joy,
             |C#|m7             |F#|m
   For the rapture’s now at hand.
         |B|m
   Yes, come, O, Lord;
         |E|              |A|
   I’m longing now for You.

2. Lord, when You come for us,
    Yes, we will be just like You—
   In body, soul and mind,
    Your holiness preserved.
   Your faithfulness is great, O Lord;
   Your promises are true.
   The blessed hope
    of our salvation’s near.

3. And when we hear the trump,
    the dead in Christ shall rise up;
   Then we who are alive
    shall meet Him in the air.
   Our God shall wipe away all tears,
   Our sorrow turn to joy;
   Rejoice, O saints,
    He’s coming back again!
