   |C|  |G|/|B| |A|m   |F|   |C|
1. All I  once held dear,
             |F|   |G|-|C|
   Built my life upon,
       |G|/|B|   |A|m    |F| - |C|
   All this  world reveres
       |A|m      |G|
   And wars to own,
   |C|     |F|    |G|       |C|
   All I once thought gain
   |C|/|E|     |F|   |G|    |A|m
   I  have counted loss—
   |C|     |G|/|B|  |A|m  |F|    |C|
   Spent and worthless now
       |A|m       |G|4
   Compared to this.

Chorus:
     |G|     |F|6   |C|   -|F|/|G|
   Knowing You, Jesus;
    |G|      |C|
   knowing You—
       |A|m      |E|m/|G|      |F|
   There is no greater thing.
             |C|/|E|             |F|/|A|
   You’re my all; You’re the best.
             |C|/|G|               |F|/|A|
   You’re my joy, my righteousness,
        |C|/|E|        |F|/|A| -|C|/|G| - |G|
   And I love You, Lord.

2. Now my heart’s desire
   Is to know You more,
   To be found in You
   And known as Yours,
   To possess by faith,
   What I could not earn—
   All surpassing gift
   Of righteousness.

3. O to know the power
   Of Your risen life,
   And to know You in
   Your suffering,
   To become like You
   In Your death, my Lord,
   So with  You  to live
   And never die.
