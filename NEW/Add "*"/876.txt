   |G|
1. I walked alone
               |C|     |G|/|B|  |A|m7
    till You brought me here,
    |G|             |E|m       |F|- |D|/|F#|
   Changed all my fear to faith.
    |G|
   Faced with Your goodness
          |C|  |G|/|B|   |A|m7
    when You came near,
    |G|             |D|    |D|7   |G|
   Saved by Your touch of grace.

Chorus:
             |C|                 |G|
   Touch of grace, beauty for ashes,
   |E|m         |A|7         |D|
   Joy for a sorrowful place,
    |G|        |G|7
   Love everlasting
         |C|    |G|/|B|  |A|m7
    has filled my heart,
   |G|              |D|         |G|
   All from Your touch of grace.

2. You put a peace
    deep within my heart
   No one could take away;
   All that I lack met by all You are,
   Filled by Your touch of grace.

3. Unending favor surrounding me,
   You bring me hope each day;
   Evâ€™rything good in my life I see
   Flows from Your touch of grace.
