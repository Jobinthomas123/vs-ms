Just a little longer,
           |C|                 |G|
 and the trump of God will sound;
               |E|m
Just a little longer,
       |A|m7           |D|
 and we’ll be glory bound!
 |G|             |G|7
Look away to Jesus;
       |C|                 |G|
 our redemption draweth nigh.
               |E|m
Just a little longer,
            |A|m7     |D|       |G|
 and we’ll meet Him in the sky!
