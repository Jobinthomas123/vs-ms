    is in Your gaze.

   Jesus, I want You to know,
   |G|              |D|          |A|
   I will follow You all my days.
       |D|/|F#|            |G|
   For no one else in history
       |B|m7   |G|
    is like You,
        |D|       |A|                |G|2
   And history itself belongs to You.
   |D|          |G|
   Alpha and Omega,
              |B|m   |G|
    You have loved me,

   And I will share eternity with You.

Chorus:
                   |B|m-|G|  |D| |A|
   It’s all about You,  Jesus;
                    |B|m-|G|
   And all this is for You,
            |D|               |A|
   For Your glory and Your fame.
                   |B|m-|G|
   It’s not about me,
          |D|
   As if You should do things
     |G|
    my way—
   |B|m             |A|
   You alone are God,
              |G|              |D|
    and I surrender to Your ways.
