1. Jesus Christ,
       |G|/|D|            |D|
    I think upon Your sacrifice;
   |G|           |D|/|F#|
   You became nothing,
     |G|              |A|sus-|A|
    poured out to death.
    |D|    |A|/|D|       |G|/|D|
   Many times I’ve wondered
             |D|
    at Your gift of life,
       |G|            |A|sus |A|      |D|
   And I’m in that place once again;
    |G|            |A|sus |A|    |D|
   I’m in that place once again.

Chorus:
   |D|/|F#|          |G|            |D|/|F#|
   Once again I look upon the cross,
               |A|
    where You died;
        |D|/|F#|            |G|
   I’m humbled by Your mercy,
             |B|m      |A|sus |A|
    and I’m broken inside.
   |B|m7           |G|
   Once again I thank You;
   |D|/|F#|          |A|           |G|   |D|
   Once again I pour out my life.

2. Now You are
    exalted to the highest place,
   King of the heavens,
    where one day I’ll bow.
   But for now I marvel
    at this saving grace,
   And I’m full of praise once again;
   I’m full of praise once again.

Bridge:
    |G|                 |A|sus-|A|
   Thank You for the cross.
    |D|/|F#|              |G|
   Thank You for the cross.
    |A|sus               |A|
   Thank You for the cross,
          |D|
    my Friend.
