      |E|             |E|7
1. As each day goes by
          |A|          |E|
    I am longing to know Him;
      |E|                  |C#|m
   As e’en through each trial,
       |F#|         |B|7
    by Him I am known.
        |A|          |B|/|A|
   The way may be dark,
        |G#|m       |C#|m
    but He is my Light;
        |A|          |E|
   Yes, I know my Jesus
         |F#|m    |B|7 |E|
    is becoming my All.

Chorus:
   |E|        |A|        |E|
   He is becoming my All;
         |E|         |C#|m        |F#|m -|B|7
   If I trust Him, I’ll never fall.
         |A|             |B|/|A|
   As I seek His dear face,
           |G#|m           |C#|m
   And He fills me with grace,
           |A|          |B|7       |E|
   I know Jesus is becoming my All.

2. When walking with Jesus,
    He holds me close to Him;
   Whenever I fear,
    His love is my stay.
   I cry unto Him;
    He answers my call,
   And I know my Jesus
    is becoming my All.

3. There’s no one on earth
    I desire beside Him;
   In heaven I have
    none other but Thee.
   My flesh and heart fail,
    but He is my Strength;
   In my heart I know
    He’s becoming my All.

4. The day’s drawing closer when
    my eyes shall see Him;
   With unending joy,
    I long for that day
   When I’ll meet the One
    Who’s always been there,
   And greet Him, My Jesus,
    Who’s become All in all.
