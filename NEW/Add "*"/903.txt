1. Day by day,
                           |D|m
    and with each passing moment,
               |G|
   Strength I find
        |G|7             |C|   |G|
    to meet my trials here;
            |C|
   Trusting in
                       |D|m7
    my Father's wise bestowment,
            |G|                      |C|
   I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.
             |C|7
   He whose heart
                         |F|     |D|m
    is kind beyond all measure,
            |G|       |G|7
   Gives unto each day
                   |C|   |E|7
    what He deems best,
         |A|m
   Lovingly, it's part of
              |D|m7
    pain and pleasure,
             |G|                   |C|
   Mingling toil with peace and rest.

2. Every day
    the Lord Himself is near me
   With a special mercy
    for each hour;
   All my cares
    He fain would bear and cheer me,
   He Whose name
    is Counselor and Power.
   The protection
    of His child and treasure,
   Is a charge
    that on Himself He laid;
   As thy days,
    Thy strength shall be in measure:
   This the pledge to me He made.

3. Help me then
    in every tribulation,
   So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
   That I lose
    not faith’s sweet consolation,
   Offered me within Thy holy Word.
   Help me Lord,
    when toil and trouble meeting,
   E’er to take,
    as from a father's hand,
   One by one, the days,
    the moments, fleeting,
   Till I reach, the promised land.
