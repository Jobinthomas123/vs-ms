Chorus:
          |G|
   Here I am,
                       |A|m7
    with outstretched arms—
   |G|/|B|                |C|
   Open and ready to hear
          |D|
    Your voice.
            |G|              |A|m7
   Speak to me, speak clearly;
        |G|/|B|
   It’s Your sweet voice
         |C|           |D|
    I’m longing to hear.
       |E|m                  |A|7
   I’m patiently waiting, Lord;
            |A|m7       |D|       |G|
   Take my hand and lead the way.

        |C|                 |D|
1. When I feel like this road
             |G|       -|E|m
    is going nowhere;
     |C|
   Trouble surrounds me
     |D|              |G|  -|D|/|F#|
    like a roaring sea,
            |E|m
   When my head hangs low
           |C|
    with shame,
           |E|m                   |C|–|G|/|B|
   And my heart is filled with pain,
       |A|m       |G|/|B|      |C|
   I need You, Lord, to answer
    |A|/|C#|   |D|4   -|D|
    when I call.

2. I’m trusting in the plan
    You have for me;
   I know that I can’t
    make it on my own.
   Lord, I’m giving You control;
   I’ll hold on and won’t let go.
   Now I’ll follow in the way
    that You have shown.
