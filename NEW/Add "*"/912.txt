    |D|m               |A|
1. Soon the Lord of glory
          |A|7             |D|m
    will come—what blest morning!
                     |A|
   We do watch and pray,
            |A|/|C|#     |D|m
    waiting for that day
             |C   |Bb|
   When we will rise
        |A|               |D|m
    to meet Him in the skies.

Chorus:
   |D|7/|F#|  |G|m     |C|
   We’ll bow before Him,
               |F|      |D|m
    and we’ll worship Him,
      |G|m       |A|
   Rejoice and evermore
        |D|m   -|D|/|F#|
    proclaim
       |G|m       |C|
   The work of glory
             |F|        |D|m
    and His wondrous grace
          |G|m      |A|        |D|m
   Shown forth in us that day.

2. Holy is Mount Zion,
    the Lord’s habitation;
   New Jerusalem,
    where God dwells with men—
   And in that place
    one day with Him we’ll reign.
