Chorus:
       |C|          |A|m
   I’m falling in love
              |D|m7  |G|
    with Your holiness;
        |C|          |A|m
   I’m lifting my hands
             |D|m7       |G|
    to Your righteousness.
     |F|            |C|/|E|
   These are the gifts
         |E|7           |A|m7
    that my heart was made for;
     |F|             |C|/|E|
   These are the things
         |D|m7              |G|
    that Your heart will bless.
      |C|           |A|m
   I give You my body,
        |D|m7           |G|
    my heart, and my mind;
           |C|           |A|m
   Please pattern them after
         |D|m7        |G|
    Your master design,
        |F|              |C|/|E|
   Till all that’s within me
        |A|m        |D|
    will only express
      |D|m7            |C|
   My love for Your beautiful
    |G|     |C|
    holiness.

        |F|    |C|
1. You saved me,
       |G|              |C|
    cleansed me from sin;
           |F|    |C|
   You forgave me,
     |G|             |C|
    gave life within.
    |F|             |C|/|E|
   Joy filled my heart
           |E|7     |A|m
    unlike ever before—
    |F|            |C|/|E|
   Yet still I cried,
    |D|m7        |G|
    “Is there more?”

2. You gave peace
    when I met You;
   You amazed me
    with all You could do.
   Your holy light,
    it shined upon me:
   I heard the call
    to purity.

3. I desire
    to be like You,
   Your holy fire
    refining me through
   Until You say,
    “Well done, My child;
   You are My love,
    My undefiled!”
