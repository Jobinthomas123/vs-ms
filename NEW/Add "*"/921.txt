(Key of |C|)
            |G|/|C|      |C|
1. By Your mercies, Lord,
   |D|m          |F|/|G|      |C|
   You’ve kept me till now;
            |D|m              |G|
   And I'll never know just how
   |F|          |G|        |C|
   You came and chose me
        |D|m              |G|
   As a vessel of Your mercy.
        |Bb|             |F|
   It’s so hard to believe,
           |G|          (|F|/|A|) (|G|/|B|)
   But I thank You.

Chorus:
             |C|
   All I can do
      |A|m               |D|m
   Is lift my hands to You
      |G|        |E|/|G#|   |A|m
   In grateful adoration.
            |G|
   I’m overwhelmed
           |F|    |G|        |C|
   By Your marvelous salvation.
   |A|m  |Bb|         |F|      |G|  |C|
   Oh, Lord, Your mercy endures.

2. By Your mercies, Lord,
   We are not consumed.
   Every morning You have proved
   That all else may change,
   Yet Your mercy e’er remains;
   And You are still the same,
   So I thank You.
