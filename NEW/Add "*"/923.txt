   |C|              |D|m         |G|
1. I was made to worship You
                     |C|    |A|m
   In spirit and in truth.
                     |D|m        |G|
   May my praise be pure and true,
                      |C|
   As incense just for You.

Chorus
             |A|m       |F|
   My heart cries out,
    |G|              |C|     |A|m
   “Holy are You, Lord.”
        |F|          |D|m
   Only pure praise
                 |G|
   Is what You deserve.
          |A|m        |D|m      |G|
   In the beauty of holiness
                  |A|m  |D|
   I will worship You;
          |C|/|E|        |F|      |G|
   In the beauty of holiness
                  |C|
   I will worship You.

2. More than just the songs I sing,
   My life’s the praise I’ll bring.
   I give to You my everything;
   Please take my offering.

3. Teach me how to worship You
   In spirit and in truth,
   So that the praise I give to You
   Ascends as sweet perfume.
