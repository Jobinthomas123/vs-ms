Chorus:
   |G|m
   Arise, oh people of Judah;
        |C|m               |G|m
   The Lord goes before you.

   Rejoice, oh children of Zion;
        |C|m                |D|4  |D|
   He’s ambushing your enemies.
   |C|m    |B|bmaj7
   As we praise Him,
      |A|dim7         |D|    |G|m
   He is giving us victory;
      |Eb|         |F|      |D|/|F#|    |G|m
   So arise, the battle is the Lord’s.

   |G|m                     |C|m
1. This is no time to be afraid;
 |G|m                         |Bb|   |D|4 |D|
   The Lion of Judah is our aid.
 |C|m7                        |B|bmaj7
   As we praise Him, He will free us;
 |C|m7                        |D|4   |D|
   Arise, oh Zion, give Him praise.

2. This is the time to declare war;
   We near the coming of the Lord.
   Though a host encamps against us,
   Yahweh conquers when we praise.

(Bridge)
    |G|m
   Give Him the praise;

   Every hand raise—

   He’s worthy!

   Come adore Him.

    |C|m
   O clap your hands;
    |D|4
   Praise Him in dance—
         |G|m
   He’s worthy!

   Bow before Him.

   |C|m
   Give Him the praise;
   |D|4
   O bless His name—
         |G|m
   He’s worthy!
