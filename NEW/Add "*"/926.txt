Chorus:
   |E|m
   For the mighty Lord of hosts
       |A|m
   Has won the victory,
   |D|
   Shouts of joy resounding
              |E|m
    from the Lord’s army.
         |A|m
   He’s lifted up the standard,
        |E|m
    destroyed the enemy;
   |D|                |B|7-
   For Jehovah Nissi
                     |E|m
    has won the victory.

   |A|m
1. Who has defied
        |E|m
    the army of the Lord?
   |D|              |B|7
   Say unto the Philistine,
            |E|m     |E|/|G#|
    “You’ll be no more.”
   |A|m
   For our God has gone
    |E|m
    as a man of war;
   |D|                         |B|7
   Sing and shout the victory
                    |E|m
    to the Lord of lords.

2. Be strong in God
    and in His mighty power.
   Do not fear the enemy;
    the battle’s won.
   Girding up yourselves
    with the strength of God,
   Stand and see deliverance
    come this very hour.

3. Trusting in Him,
    we’ll never be ashamed;
   We shall rise up on the wings
    of prayer and praise.
   For we know that hell
    surely won’t prevail—
   Everlasting Word of God
    never, ever fails.
