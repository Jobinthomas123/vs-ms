1. Jesus Christ—
       |G|              |A|
    rejected and despised,
          |F#|m             |G|
   All our sins on Him applied,
           |E|m              |A|
   As the Father left His side.
            |D|          |G|          |A|
   He was bruised for all iniquities.
      |F#|m              |G|
   To set the captives free,
          |E|m              |A|
   Blood flowed from Calvary.

Chorus
   |G|        |A|          |F#|m      |B|m
   Greater love has no man than this,
            |E|m
   For You laid down
         |A|        |D| - |D|7
   Your life for me;
           |G|            |A|
   And You showed Your love
       |F#|m          |B|m
   For me when You died,
         |G|
   So I thank You for
         |A|4   |A|    |D|
   Your great sacrifice.

2. We see You,
    the Lamb Who was slain,
   The Author of our faith,
    the Giver of God's grace.
   Unto You,
    we render all our praise;
   You redeemed Adam's race,
   And by Your blood we’re saved.

3. It is You, clothed in crimson red,
   With the thorns upon Your head,
   And the side
    from which You bled.
   Crucified,
    for sinners You have died,
   Bringing healing by Your stripes,
   And destroying the power
    of death.
