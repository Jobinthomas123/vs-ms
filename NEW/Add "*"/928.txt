Chorus:
   |D|      |D|/|F#|          |G|     |D|
   All of You, filling all of me;
           |B|m   |B|m/|A|           |E|m - |A|
   More of You, Lord, let me see.
            |G|             |D|
   For this world and its gain
          |B|m        |E|/|G#|
   Is but empty and vain—
             |E|m               |A|    |D|
   Only Your love could ever satisfy.

            |G|            |A|
1. For what more could I ask
                  |G|        |D|
   From One Who’s given so much?
             |B|m              |B|m/|A|
   I’ve been blessed in this life
   |D|/|F#|         |G|         |A|
   Filled with glory and grace.
           |B|m             |A|/|F#|
   Oh, and yet, there’s a cry
             |G|          |E|m
   From the depth of my heart;
            |D|/|F#|          |G|
   There is more, so much more
             |A|4   |A|
    of Your love.

2. To Your presence I come,
   Emptied of self and vain pride,
   To receive from Your hand
   All You richly provide;
   Not for good I have done,
   But because You are good—
   All I need
    flows to bring me new life.

3. Though the path of Your will
   May lead to sorrow and pain,
   Yet I’ll cling to the One
   Who said, “My peace I give.”
   And I’ll look to the cross
   Where You suffered and died,
   Till I rise to my home in the skies.
