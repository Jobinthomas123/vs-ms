Chorus:
         |D|
   When my heart is
    |A|/|C#| |B|m    |A|m7 -|D|7
    overwhelmed,
   |G|              |D|/|F#|
   Lead me to the Rock
            |E|m          |A|
    that is higher than I;
           |D|
   When my heart is
    |F#|   |G|     |D|/|F#|
    overwhelmed,
   |E|m               |A|        |D|
   Lead me to Your presence, Lord.

               |G|     |A|      |F#|m  |B|m
1. There's no other place I know
        |E|m     |A|       |A|m7   |D|7
   Where I can run and hide;
           |G|       |A|/|C#|     |A|/|F#|  |B|m
   He's my Shelter from the storm—
         |E|m     |A|    |D|
   It's there I will abide.

2. Every burden and each care
   I lay down at His feet;
   As I cling to Him in prayer—
   A fellowship so sweet.

3. As I wait upon my Lord,
   My soul finds perfect rest;
   There I know my prayer is heard,
   And I am truly blest.

4. In His presence I will dwell
   Throughout eternity;
   In that glory none can tell,
   Where all is joy and peace.
