            |C|     |G|/|B|
1. Though a host encamps
    |A|m
    against me,
      |F|                  |G|
   In this I will stand strong;
            |C|          |G|/|B|
   Though a war should rise
    |A|m
    against my soul,
      |D|m        |A|m  |G|
   I know where I belong.
        |D|m            |G|
   My desire is one thing,
                |G|/|E|
   And that one thing
                |A|m
    will I seek for—
      |F|            |C|/|E|
   To dwell all of my days
          |D|m7   |D|/|F#|   |G|4  |G|
   In the house of the Lord.

Chorus:
   |C|/|E|  |F|         |G|4  |G|    |C|   |A|m
   To behold the beauty of You—
                |F|                |A|m
   All that You are thrilling my heart,
         |D|m       |F|     |G|
   Until all that I can do
      |C|/|E| |F|        |G|        |A|m
   Is to adore the glory of You.
       |D|m              |A|m
   Oh, Lord, all of my days
          |D|m              |A|m
   I will worship, I will praise
       |D|m       |G|  |G|/|B|    |C|
   The glorious beauty of You.

2. There were many other beauties
   That once my heart longed for,
   But they've been displaced
    by just one thing—
   The glory of the Lord.
   Such as eye has never seen
   Nor human heart
    could understand—
   The grandeur and glory
   In the things that God has planned.

3. Every storm will soon be over,
   Our trials turned to gold,
   When the Lord shall come
    and rapture us
   To worship at His throne.
   Oh the fire of His love—
   I’ll see the glory of that place!
   For this, I have chosen
   To forever seek His face.
