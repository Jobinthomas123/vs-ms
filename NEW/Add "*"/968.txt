(Key of |C|)
   |A|m      |G|/|B|     |C|
1. Oh, to see the dawn
             |D|m     |C|/|E|
    of the darkest day:
   |F|              |C|/|E|     |D|m  |F|/|C| |G|/|B|
   Christ on the road to Cal——va——ry.
   |A|m        |G|/|B|     |C|
   Tried by sinful men,
               |D|m      |C|/|E|
    torn and beaten, then
   |F|            |C|/|E|  |F|  |G|sus - |G|/|F|
   Nailed to a cross of wood.

Chorus:
   |C|/|E|        |F|    |G|/|B|      |C|
   This, the power of the cross:
   |C|/|E|       |F|   |G|/|B|     |C|
   Christ became sin for us,
   |C|/|E|         |F|   |D|/|F#|        |G|
   Took the blame, bore the wrath—
   |G|/|F|  |C|/|E|     |F|   |C|/|G|        |C|
   We stand forgiven at the cross.

2. Oh, to see the pain
    written on Your face,
   Bearing the awesome
    weight of sin.
   Ev’ry bitter thought,
    ev’ry evil deed,
   Crowning Your blood-stained brow.

3. Now the daylight flees,
    now the ground beneath
   Quakes as its Maker
    bows His head.
   Curtain torn in two,
    dead are raised to life;
   Finished the vict’ry cry.

4. Oh, to see my name
    written in the wounds,
   For through Your suffering
    I am free.
   Death is crushed to death,
    life is mine to live,
   Won through Your selfless love.

Chorus 2:
   This, the power of the cross:
   Son of God slain for us.
   What a love, what a cost!
   We stand forgiven at the cross.
