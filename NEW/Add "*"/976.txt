1. What does the cross really mean―
              |E|m     |D|/|F#|    |G|
   How Jesus died to set me free?
                |B|m    |D|      |A|
   The cross is only foolishness
          |B|m     |G|          |B|m    |G|
   Till I truly see how my wickedness
   |E|m                  |A|
   Nailed Him to that tree.
                    |G|         |D|
   And, there will never be a way
               |F#|      |B|m
   That I could ever repay
                |G|
   All that He did for me
   |E|m –|A| – |D|
   On Calvary.

Chorus 1:
                  |A|
   That's why I thank Him,
    |D| –|G|  |D|
   Thank Him―
      |D|/|F#|           |E|m
   For taking all my sin,
        |G|             |E|m
   And now I live for Him
  |D|/|F#|      |A|            |D|
   In gratitude for the cross.

2. What is the beauty of the cross,
   Where it did seem that all was
    lost―
   That place of mockery and shame
   Where my Savior died
   Bore for me such pain
   When He took my place?
   It is the love He showed to me
   When my life He did redeem.
   Grateful I’ll ever be
   For Calvary.

Chorus 2:
   That’s why I love Him,
   Love Him―
   Because He first loved me,
   And now I live for Him
   In gratitude for the cross.

3. What does the cross mean for me
   Now that my Lord has set me
    free?
   The cross is not a place to fear
   Because by His blood
   He has drawn me near,
   And now I can see
   That there can only be one way
   That I could ever repay
   All that He did for me
   On Calvary.

Chorus 3:
   That's why I serve Him,
   Serve Him.
   His servant I will be,
   And I will live for Him
   In gratitude for the cross.
