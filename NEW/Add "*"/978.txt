Chorus:
    |B|m                |G|
   Jesus, quench my thirst;
                      |D|
   Hear my desperate cry,
                   |F#|sus4
   For I know that You,
         |F#|           |B|m
   You alone can satisfy.
                     |G|
   Nothing else will do;
                  |D|
   You are my supply.
                 |F#|sus4
   All I need is You;
         |F#|           |B|m (for verse: |G|)
   You alone can satisfy.

  (|G|)      |D|           |A|
1. As the deer panteth for the brooks
          |B|m            |A|m      |G|
   So my soul thirsteth after Thee.
           |D|
   I have tasted and I know
          |A|
    that You are good,
          |F#|                      |B|m
   But I long to all Your fulness see.

2. There is not anything on earth
   Nor in all of the heav'n above
   I desire; there is just one thing I
    askâ€•
   To have You alone, the One I
    love.
