Chorus:
    |A|                  |C#|m
   Called, chosen, and faithful—
           |D|             |E|
   That’s what I want to be.
    |A|                  |C#|m
   Called, chosen, and faithful—
          |D|                 |E|
   Your glorious face I’ll see.
      |D|
   No matter the cost
        |C#|m
    that I have to pay,
         |D|
   I’m choosing to follow You
     |A|          |E|
    all of the way.
    |A|                  |C#|m
   Called, chosen, and faithful―
   |E|                 |D| - |A|
   By Your grace, I pray.

             |A|
1. You have called me
            |C#|m
    out of darkness
     |D|        |A| - |E|
   Into Your light.
             |A|
   You have called me
            |C#|m – |F#|m
    from my emptiness
        |D|                   |E|
   And filled me with Your life.
            |F#|m            |C#|m
   You have called me unto holiness
        |D|                |E|
   That I might be Your bride.
            |A|
   Oh, how high this heavenly
    |C#|m—–—|F#|m
    call——ing
            |D|       |E|       |A|
   Oh, how precious is this life.

2. We’re Your chosen generation
    although we’re few.
   You have chosen weak
    and foolish ones
   To find their strength in You.
   In the furnace of affliction, Lord,
   Your Word will see me through,
   And in all of life’s temptations
   Zealous love will keep me true.

3. My desire is to be faithful
    in all I do.
   Yes, I’ll take my cross
    and run my race
   To finally win You.
   You have made me
    more than conqueror
   An overcomer, too.
   Oh, the joy of having served You;
   It’s the least that I could do.
