Chorus:
           |B|m        |G|-|A|      |B|m
   This is Zion, My dwe–lling place,
            |G|          |E|m-|A|    |B|m
   Ever My rest – I’ve cho–sen it.
           |B|m         |E|m-|B|m
   I will arise – oh, oh, oh
         |A|     |B|m
    – I will arise.
           |E|m
   All your enemies
           |A|           |D|
    I’ll clothe with shame;
            |E|m
   You will worship
          |A|      |B|m
    and exalt My name.

                |E|m                |B|m
1. Here I will dwell; here I will rest.
               |F#|
   You are My chosen;
             |B|m
    you are blessed.
    |B|7       |E|m         |B|m
   I’ll satisfy abundantly,
             |F#|
   For I’ve promised
                  |B|m
    to meet your need.

2. Let my saints shout;
    let them rejoice,
   And all My servants dance for joy.
   I will anoint and separate
   Those whom I’ve chosen
    with Me to reign.

3. For I have sworn and cannot lie―
   All of your children will be mine.
   If they will keep My covenant,
   They will serve Me
    in righteousness.
