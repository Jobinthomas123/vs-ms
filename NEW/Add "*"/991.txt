Chorus:
   |D|             |G|m/|D|  |D|
   Oh righteous, holy God,
              |E|m - |A|
   We worship You,
                 |G|m         |D|
   For You’ve redeemed our lives
               |F#|m7 -- |A|dim7/|B|
   And made us new.
                   |E|m7             -|D|
   You’ve called us to Your throne;
                    |D|/|C|         |G|/|B|
   You’ve called us as Your own.

1. Before the world’s foundation
          |E|m7
   Triune God had made a plan;
          |F#|m7            |B|m
   Fallen man would be perfected
            |A|m                |D|7
   By the blood of Calvary’s Lamb.
     |G|               |F#| - |F#|/|A#|
   While we still hated You—
    |B|m               |E|/|G#|
   Lost and bound by sin,
              |E|m       |D|/|F#|   |E|/|G#|
   Lord, You gave Your Son to die
         |A|      |D|
   Our lives to win.

2. All who call upon the Savior
   Are forgiven from their sins.
   By repentance comes salvation,
   For ye must be born again.
   And for sin’s dark nature in us,
   The remedy You gave—
   For baptism’s waters
   Become the old man’s grave.

3. Now Your Holy Spirit fills us
   With the power from above
   That Your church might be found
    holy, blameless in love—
   Watching, waiting, looking for
   You’re coming back again;
   Then we’ll worship You
   In New Jerusalem.
