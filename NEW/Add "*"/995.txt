1. Christ will me His aid afford—
   |A|m        |G|    |G|7        |C|
   Never to fall, never to fall.
                    |F|        |C|
   While I find my precious Lord
     |F|          |C|/|G|   |G|7          |C|
   Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

Chorus:
    |G|7       |C|  |G|   |C|
   Jesus is now and ever will be
     |F|        |G|/|F|        |C|       |G|
   Sweeter than all the world to me.
    |C|       |G|7        |C|     |F|
   Since I heard His loving call—
                |C|/|E|   |G|7          |C|
   Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

2. I will follow all the way
   Hearing Him call,
    hearing Him call.
   Finding Him from day to day
   Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

3. Tho' a vessel I may be—
   Broken and small,
    broken and small.
   Yet His blessings fall on me
   Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

4. When I reach the crystal sea
   Voices will call, voices will call.
   But my Savior's voice will be
   Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.
