1. I then shall live
    C  G/B       F/A     G/B-C
    as one who's been forgiven;
    C   G/B  C    Gmaj7/D
   I'll walk with joy
    C   G/B     F     G   C
    to know my debts are paid.
   C     G/B  Am
   I know my name
              Em    G7    Dm
    is clear before my Father;
  Dm-Edim7-Dm/F-C/G
   I am His  child
       F/G          E
    and I am not afraid.
    C      G/B-Am
   So greatly  pardoned
         Em      G7     Dm
    I'll forgive my brother;
    Dm-Edim7-Dm/F-C/G
   The  law of   love
      F/G    G7     C
    I gladly will obey.

2. I then shall live as one
    who's learned compassion;
   I've been so loved
    that I'll risk loving too.
   I know how fear
    builds walls instead of bridges;
   I'll dare to see
    another's point of view.
   And when relationships
    demand commitment,
   Then I'll be there
    to care and follow through.

3. Your kingdom come
    around and through and in me;
   Your pow'r and glory
    let them shine through me.
   Your hallowed name,
    oh may I bear with honor,
   And may Your living kingdom
    come in me.
   The Bread of Life,
    oh may I share with honor,
   And may You feed
    a hungry world through me.

Ending:
    Ab-C  Fm-C/E Fm/D - C
   Amen,  Amen,   Amen.
