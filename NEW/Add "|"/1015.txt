Cmaj7-        Em
   Fresh fire let it fall;

   O God, hear our call.

1.   We are hungry,
    D       Em    -C/E-G/D-D
    we are thirsty,
Em-C/E-     G/D
     Crying out
         D      C  -D/C-C-D/C
    for more of You.
Em-C/E-           G/D
     Lord, we are desperate
    D        Em   -C/E-G/D-D
    for Your mercy;
Em-C/E-     G/D      D          C
     Let us burn to know Your truth.
             G/B
   Light a flame in us now;
   Bsus            B
   Send Your holy fire down!

2. We have left
    our hearts unguarded;
   We confess we've walked away.
   Lord, take us back
    to where we started—
   Where we first found
    love and grace.
   Light a flame in us now;
   Send Your holy fire down!

Bridge:
 C-              G
   More of Your love,
                 D    - Dsus-D
   More of Your power—
 C-          G         D      Dsus-D
   Send a revival; we need it now!
 C-           G
   Stir up a fire;
                 D    - Dsus-D
   Let it burn brighter.
   Bsus                B
   Let the flame burn higher,

    higher, higher!

Ending:
 B-             Em
   Revive us again!
