    C          F
1. Toiling in life,
             G          C
    gaining nothing in hand,
            F
   Feeling sorrows
           G           C
    that plague every man;
           F        C
   Though many do faint
        E            Am
    and others complain,
           F
   Oh, but I trust
         G            C
    in that precious name.

Chorus:
     C/E     F       G/B      C
   I rest assured, I will be home—
                F  -G          C
   No more the pain, no more alone.
                F  -G               Em-Am
   I will not faint; I’ll run this race.
                Dm
   My joy shall be
        G                C
    to see my Savior’s face.

2. Years fade away,
    and some saints have gone on
   To the land we can see from afar.
   While here I remain,
    my gaze stays the same—
   On that land
    where forever I’ll roam.

3. When my eyes dim
    and my breath doth depart
   From this body created with clay,
   I’ll rise with new life,
    then shout in the sky,
   “Hallelu! I am home! I am home!”

4. I’ll walk those streets
    that are paved with pure gold.
   What a sight
    when my eyes shall behold—
   My Jesus, my King,
    as He beckons me in,
   “Welcome home!
    Oh my child, welcome home!”

Final Chorus:
   How glorious! I will be home—
   The angels sing,
    the saints enthroned.
   The King of kings,
          E      Am-D/F#
    Who died for me—
   My Love, my Joy for all eternity.
