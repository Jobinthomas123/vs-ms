2. All Thy works
    with joy surround Thee;
   Earth and heav’n reflect Thy rays.
   Stars and angels sing around Thee,
   Center of unbroken praise.
   Field and forest,
    vale and mountain,
   Flowery meadow, flashing sea,
   Chanting bird
    and flowing fountain
   Call us to rejoice in Thee.

3. Thou art giving and forgiving,
   Ever blessing, ever blest.
   Wellspring of the joy of living,
   Ocean depth of happy rest,
   Thou our Father,
   Christ our Brother
   All who live in love are Thine.
   Teach us how to love each other;
   Lift us to the joy divine.

4. Mortals join the mighty chorus
   Which the morning stars began.
   Father love is reigning o’er us;
   Brother love binds man to man.
   Ever singing march we onward–
   Victors in the midst of strife.
   Joyful music lifts us sunward
   In the triumph song of life.
