            D
1. When I think of Calvary-
           G   D
   What a mystery
           G
   That Christ my King
          Em7    A
   Would die for me.
                 D   D/F#-G
   And now He’s made me free,
           D  F#m7
   Yet my liberty
                  G      A-Bm7
   Has made me Christ’s alone;
            D/A  A   D
   Bound to Him I’ll be.

Chorus:
             D/F#    G   D
   With the cross before me,
           A        D
   I will follow Christ;
                   G D
   He bought my freedom
             Asus4-A
    with His life.
                     G     D/F#
   I’ll leave this world behind;
               F#/A#     Bm
   Cling to my Savior’s side,
              D/A       A
   For He did purchase me
        G    D
    at Calvary.

2. To the cross I’ll e’er be true,
   And in gratitude
   I’ll take my cross
   My life to lose.
   Cause at the cross I die,
   Yet I find new life;
   For it’s Christ in me,
   Tis no longer I.

3. Of the cross I’ll testify,
   For I can’t deny
   That its power touched
   And changed my life.
   When Jesus came to me,
   I was yet unclean;
   But He washed my sins
   There at Calvary.

Bridge:
   G-A   D
Calvary,   Calvary,
 G
The more I see,
 G/A  D
The more it means to me.
G F#7 - Bm
Calvary, Calvary,
 G
The more I see,
  G/AD
The more it means to me.
