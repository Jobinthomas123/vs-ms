(Key of C)
                   Am7
1. Deep within my heart I feel
                    Dm7
   A melody that’s rising–
                    Am7
   Whispers from my home above
                      Gsus4-G
   Where holy angels shine.
                Am7
   Heaven is a place
                           Dm7
   Where all forever is surprising;
        F         G
   And God is my God,
           Am
   Forever mine.
        Dm               Am
   The hours are passing by;
                             Dm7
   I see the world fade into darkness.
                Am7
   People all around are charmed
                     Gsus4-G
   By dangers of the night.
                         Am7
   But I will leave the shadows,

   And I’ll walk
                 Dm7
    in paths of brightness;
       F           G
   My Savior leads me
                 Am7
    to gates of light.

Chorus:
            Fmaj7         G
   ‘Til that day I’ll be kept
            C           Am
   In the shade of Your hand;
          Fmaj7           G
   By the pow’r of Your grace,
           C         Am
   I will evil withstand.
             F         Dm
   With no fear of the foe,
          Em-Am-  Dm
   I can joyfully sing;
       Fmaj7         Dm
   I am safe in the shelter
       F  F/G        C
    of El Shaddai’s wings.

2. So I will never fear to face
   The trials of tomorrow;
   My God will never leave me
   Even in the midst of fire.
   I will never let my burdens
   Tie me down in sorrow;
   My anchor is Christ–
   My one desire.
   Jesus, keep me close to You
   These dark and final moments;
   Give me strength to reach the end–
   This race I have to run.
   Someday I will stand with You
   In white and spotless garments,
   Then heaven will shout,
   “The cross has won!”
