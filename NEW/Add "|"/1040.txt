Chorus:
              C          G
   Bless the Lord, O my soul,
       F                C
   And all that is within me
   Dm               G
   Bless His holy name.
               C         G
   Bless the Lord, O my soul,
        F               C
   And all that is within me
    Dm        G     C
   Bless His holy name.

                 G
1. Let’s not forget
     G/B                C
   All of His gracious benefits:
                F
   Our sins forgiven
    G                C
   And our sickness healed.
                 F      G
   The crown of lovingkindness
               Em       Am
   He’s placed on our heads;
         D                  G
   With joy our hearts can sing.

2. He will not chide
   Nor keep His anger ever;
   He does not deal
   According to our sins.
   For just as high as heavens
   Are above the earth
   His mercy ever rings.

3. From out of darkness
   Jesus has redeemed our lives,
   To walk in light
   And serve Him joyfully
   In holiness and righteousness
   For all our days
   Until His face we see.

4. Even in the midst of trials
   He is with us;
   His loving hand is guiding
   All the way.
   And when the test is over
   We’ll come forth as gold
   By His amazing grace.

5. The mercies of our God
   Are never-ending;
   From age to age
   His love is still the same.
   What He’s begun in us
   He’s faithful to complete;
   He’s worthy of all praise.

6. The coming of our Lord
   Is soon approaching;
   We’re looking for the mercy
   Of our King,
   When in a moment,
   In a twinkling we’ll be changed
   And then forever sing.
