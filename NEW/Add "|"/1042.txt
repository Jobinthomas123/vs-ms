1. The Lord, He stands among us;
         F    F2/A         G
   His countenance shines forth.
       C/E             Am
   We bow our hearts before Him;
       Dm          G
   It’s Jesus we adore.

Chorus:
                  C
   Lift up Your voice,
               Am
   Sing and rejoice;
         F               G
   The Lord our God is mighty.
                 C
   With banner raised,

   Sing out His praise;
        F     G        C
   Our God is in our midst.

   His sword drawn high to war.
   Our battle cry His praises;
   In vict’ry we march forth.

3. The Lord, He stands among us;
   His presence leads our way.
   We’re going on toward Zion;
   His love our only stay.

4. The Lord, He stands among us;
   The joy of vict’ry sings.
   With longing He awaits us–
   Fruit of His suffering.
