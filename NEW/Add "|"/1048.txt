1. Praise the Lord, O my soul,
       F/A      G/B     C
   For all that He has done.

   Praise Him

    all this heavenly host,
            F/A     G/B        C
   For the battles fought and won.
                       Em
   Praise Him all His chosen ones
   Dm                  G
   For His great high call.

   All creation join this song;
    Dm                    G
   Praise Him great and small.

Chorus:
            C
   For we know
         F           Em-Am
   Whom we have believed,
             Dm
   And this faith
        G      C
   Cannot be shaken;
       C/E         F           D/F#
   For they that trust in the Lord
        C/G         A7
   Will never be ashamed,
      Dm
   So lift your voice
         G         C
   And praise the Lord!

2. Praise Him in the desert lands
   When no one is around.
   Praise Him in the jungles dense
   Where dangers do abound.
   Praise Him on the hilltop
   When the vict’ry flag is high.
   Praise Him in the valley deep
   When sorrows multiply.

3. Praise Him through the tear drops
   When He seems so far away.
   Praise Him through the midnight
   When you feel you’ve gone astray.
   Praise Him when relief appears
   And all is well once more.
   Praise Him when light disappears
   And life seems insecure.

4. Praise Him
    when you place your feet
   In Jordan’s swelling tide.
   Praise Him
    when you brave the waves
   And reach the other side.
   Praise Him
    when you’re home at last
   And see His glorious face.
   Praise and shout and leap for joy
   And sing His endless praise.
