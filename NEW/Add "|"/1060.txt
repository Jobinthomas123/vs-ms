             E   A2    E
1. Lord, I come, I confess.
   B/D#   C#m7   Bsus  A2
   Bowing here I find my rest;
                E     A2    E
   And without You I fall apart.
               B
   You're the One that guides
    A2
    my heart.

Chorus:
             E       A     E   B/D#
   Lord, I need You, oh I need You!
   C#m7   A      E    B
   Ev'ry hour I need You;
      E/G#    A         E/B    A/C#
   My one defense, my righteousness,
        E/B        B    E
    Oh God, how I need You!

2. Where sin runs deep,
   Your grace is more.
   Where grace is found,
   Is where You are.
   And where You are,
    Lord, I am free;
   Holiness is Christ in me.

Bridge:
        A      E/G#    Bsus    C#m7
   So teach my song to rise to You
                   E/G#     A2
   When temptation comes my way;
              A        E/G#
   And when I cannot stand
         Bsus    C#m7
    I'll fall on You,
   A2               Bsus  E
   Jesus, You're my hope and stay!
