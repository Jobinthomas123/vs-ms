   Cast inside by evil men,
   Yet prevailed God’s promises—
   I will be with you.

4. Child, there is no need to fear;
   Guiding you, I’m always near.
   When the future seems unclear,
   I am there with you.

5. Yahweh Shammah is My name—
   Precious truth can never change.
   Every moment, every day
   I will be with you.

6. Through the fire you may go,
   But you’ll never be alone.
   As the fourth Man said of old,
   “I am here with you.”

7. Soon from heaven He will shout,
   Trumpet suddenly will sound.
   In a twinkling we’ll be found
   Ever with the Lord.
