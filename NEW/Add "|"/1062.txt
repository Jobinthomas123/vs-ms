    D               G       D
1. Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
    G      D      A
   By His own betrayed.
        Bm              G       Bm
   The sin of man and wrath of God
         G     A--D
   Has been on Jesus laid.

Chorus:
           Bm       G
   Oh that rugged cross,
          D - A
    my salvation,
               Bm
   Where Your love poured
     G     A
    out over me.
           G          D         A Bm
   Now my soul cries out, hallelujah!
               G    A-D
   Praise and honor unto Thee.

2. Silent as He stood accused,
   Beaten, mocked, and scorned.
   Bowing to the Father's will,
   He took a crown of thorns.

3. Sent of heaven, God's own Son,
   To purchase and redeem
   And reconcile the very ones
   Who nailed Him to that tree.

4. See, the stone is rolled away—
   Behold the empty tomb.
   Hallelujah, God be praised!
   He's risen from the grave.

Bridge:
           Bm       G
   Now my debt is paid—
            D      A
    it is paid in full,
          Bm         G
   By the precious blood
             D      A
    that my Jesus spilled.
            Bm       G
   Now the curse of sin
            D      A
    has no hold on me,
            Bm        G
   Whom the Son sets free
            D      A
    Oh, is free indeed.
