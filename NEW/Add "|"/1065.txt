     C#m            B
1. Unrivaled, uncontested,
           E/G#        A
    all majestic You reign;
         C#m         B
   Far above, beyond all,
               E/G#         A
    our human minds can contain
      C#m          B/D#
   Magnificently glorious,
          Amaj7     E/G#
    and exceedingly wise—
                F#m
   How could it be then,
         A                   B
    that I have caught Your eye?

Chorus:
              E
   Who am I, Lord,
         A/E                E  –B/D#
    that You would think of me?
              C#m      E/G#
   What am I, Lord, to be pursued
      C#m--E/G#-F#m – B7
    relent—less—ly?
         E         B/D#
   To redeem and restore me,
                  C#m          Am6
    You gave Your life on that tree.
             E/B         B7
   Who am I, Lord, but Yours,
         Esus4 –E
    only Yours.

2. Exalted, yet You lower Your eyes
    to behold heav’n;
   Further still You descend
    searching earth's inhabitants
   And then Your holy hands
    comb through the dust
    and dung to raise
   This poor and needy beggar
    to Your gaze.

3. Oh such love shed upon me
    whilst I was filthy still
   To redeem, to make clean,
    precious blood at Calvary spilled.
   You set apart and sanctify,
    and call to share Your throne
   A king, a priest—
    a son You call Your own.

Bridge:
               A         B/A
   To be with You eternally,
           C#m              G#m
   Amazing love, how can it be?
                    A
   To share Your throne
                  B/A
    to wear that crown,
            C#m
   Amazing grace,
                   G#m
    how sweet the sound!
               A             B/A
   From You, ne’er again to part,
                  F#m
   Then sings my soul,
           A       Bsus4 – B
    How great Thou art!
