     C/E               Am
1. I hear the voice of Jesus,
   F               G/B
   Oh so sweet and clear—
    Dm                 E7(b9)
   Words of peace and comfort
   Am7             C9
   Whispered in my ear.
        F             Dm
   He tells me He can do
       Em              Am
   Anything He chooses to,
        F          C
   And yet He reassures me
        Dm            C9
   He won’t let go of me.

Chorus:
             Fmaj7
   Sovereign Lord,
         Dm             Em
   You hold me in Your hand.
       F                C
   My life is in Your hand;
              G – C9
   Here I’ll stay.
            F
   And I’m safe
             G/F              C/E
   No matter what may come my way
               F             Am
   Cause there is no better place
                 Dm
   Than in Your plan
          F/G              F – C
   In the hollow of Your hand.

2. I hear the voice of Jesus
   This is how I know
   I am my Beloved’s;
   I’m His very own.
   He shelters me each day;
   Jesus is my hiding place,
   And what a joy to know I’m
   The apple of His eye.

3. I hear the voice of Jesus,
   And now I can see
   Visions of my homeland
   In eternity.
   My destiny is sure,
   For in Jesus I’m secure;
   I’ll stay within my Lord’s hand
   And safely reach that land.
