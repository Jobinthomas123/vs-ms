1. All of creation,

   All of the earth,
   Bm
   Make straight a highway,

   A path for the Lord—
D–                  A
   Jesus is coming soon.

2. Call back the sinner,
   Wake up the saint,
   Let every nation
    shout of Your fame—
   Jesus is coming soon.

Chorus:
Bm–              G                D
   Like a bride waiting for her groom
               F#m7             Bm
   We'll be a church ready for You.
                G               D
   Every heart longing for our King,
      F#m          G –
   We sing, "Even so,   come,
        D       A
   Lord Jesus, come.
         G –
   Even so,  come,
        D       A
   Lord Jesus, come.”

3. There will be justice,
   All will be new
   Your name forever,
    faithful and true—
   Jesus is coming soon.

Bridge:
          G
   So we wait,
       Bm       A
   We wait for You.
            G
   God, we wait;
           Bm     A
   You're coming soon.
