Chorus:
      D  Em  D/F#
   Above all else, keep me
     G           A4– A
    faithful to You,
      G          D/F#
   Steadfast, immoveable,
        Bm                  A
    in all You’ve called me to.
         Bm              A/C#
   If I start to lose my way,
            D     D/F#     Em7
    if my heart begins to stray
            G2
   Draw me close,
      F#7                     Bm
    until Your love breaks through.
             Esus4– E
   Above all else,
            G/A
    keep me faithful,
             D
   Lord, to You.

         D        Em     D/F#
1. Dear Jesus, I come to You with
           G             Asus4 – A
    some questions on my mind;
               G               D/F#
   There are problems I can’t solve,
             Bm               A/C#
   There are answers I can’t find.
          Bm               D/A
   Yet I know You’re the Solution
          G                  D/F#
   When things are still unclear,
           Em                G
   That is why I make this plea
                A4 – A
    for You to hear:

2. You told us that in these days
    many saints would fall away.
   We must take heed to ourselves;
    we must watch and always pray,
   Though I know these exhortations
   At times my love seems weak,
   So I cast myself on You
    and Your face seek.

3. “Against the evildoers,
    who for Me will take a stand?”
   I hear You cry:  “Mine eyes are on
    the faithful of the land.”
   “Who, me, Lord?
   I’m not worthy!”
   My feeble heart replies;
   Then I see Your smile,
    and grace is in Your eyes.

Bridge:
            D
   I will serve You
   Em–        D/F#    – Gm6
    because I love You;
            Bm   A–       G
   You have given life to me.
           D
   I will follow
   Em–      D/F#     Gm6
    until I hear You say,
         Bm               A
   “Well done, faithful servant,
             G
    come to Me.”
