              D
1. When the trumpet of the Lord

    shall sound,
        G                D
   And time shall be no more,

   And the morning breaks,
                         A7
   Eternal, bright and fair;
             D
   When the saved of earth

    shall gather
        G              D
   Over on the other shore,
           D/A                A7
   And the roll is called up yonder,
              D
    I'll be there.

Chorus:
             D
   When the roll is called up yonder,
             A7
   When the roll is called up yonder,
             D                G â€“ Em
   When the roll is called up yonder,
            D/A                A7
   When the roll is called up yonder,
             D
   I'll be there.

2. On that bright and
    cloudless morning
   When the dead in Christ shall rise,
   And the glory of His
    resurrection share;
   When His chosen ones shall gather
   To their home beyond the skies,
   And the roll is called up yonder,
    I'll be there.

3. Let us labor for the Master
   From the dawn till setting sun;
   Let us talk of all His wondrous
    love and care;
   Then when all of life is over,
   And our work on earth is done,
   And the roll is called up yonder,
   I'll be there.
