              A         A/C#
1. There’s a song in my heart
        Bm
    that I cannot deny;
             E      B7    Esus  - E
   It’s the song my Jesus gave me
            A     A/C#
   When He lifted me out
    Bm
    of the miry clay,
              E             A - Em
   And washed all my sins away.

Chorus:
     A7         D - Bm
   Praise the Lord!
                A - F#m
   Praise His name!
       Bm7     E           A - A/C#
   He alone deserves all praise,
             D          F#m
   And this song I will raise
          Bm       E      A
   'Til I see His loving face.

2. Oh, this song that I sing—
    it was not here before,
   But when Jesus came
    He brought it.
   Now my days are filled
    with overflowing joy;
   I rejoice in Him alone!

3. In the darkest of nights
    this melody remains,
   Springing up with joyful praises.
   As I sing to Him, His glory
    fills my soul,
   Giving strength to carry on.

4. In the morn when I rise,
   I hear it once again;
   It's a song that has no ending.
   Though the tune may change,
    the message stays the same—
   The great message of His love.

5. When the battle is strong,
   I still can hear the song,
   For my Captain goes forth singing.
   I find courage
    when I hear His melody;
   'Tis the song of victory.

6. There's a tune that attracts
    the ear of my Beloved;
   It's the song of His redeemed ones.
   Though the angels praise Him,
    singing all the time,
   Jesus longs to hear His bride.

7. If you’re listening today
    and have no song within,
   Come to Jesus— He will save you.
   Then from deep inside
    you’ll hear the song begin,
   As He fills your heart with joy.
