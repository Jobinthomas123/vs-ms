             C              Dm
1. Are you looking for the fullness
           Em              Dm
   Of the blessing of the Lord
             C        Am     G
   In your heart and life today?
              Dm              G
   Claim the promise of your Father,
           C              Am
   Come according to His word,
            G     D7        G7
   In the blessed old-time way.

Chorus:
            C                 F
   He will fill your heart today
            C Am
   to overflowing;
           Dm              G
   As the Lord commandeth you,
                C        D7    G
   "Bring your vessels, not a few."
            C                F
   He will fill your heart today
            C Am
    to overflowing
            Dm     G   G7   C
   With the Holy Ghost and pow'r.

2. Bring your empty earthen vessels,
   Clean thro' Jesus' precious blood.
   Come, ye needy, one and all,
   And in human consecration
   Wait before the throne of God,
   'Til the Holy Ghost shall fall.

3. Like the cruse of oil unfailing
   Is His grace forevermore,
   And His love unchanging still;
   And according to His promise
   With the Holy Ghost and pow'r,
   He will ev'ry vessel fill.
