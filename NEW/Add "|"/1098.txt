1. I’ve lost count of all the times
               |E|m -
    I’ve fallen short,
           |F|
   But You always pick me up
         |A|m           |G|sus4-G
    and tell me to move forward.
              C
   When I’ve lost the strength to fight
                  Em -
    this fight for   You,
          F
   You remind me through
               C/G           Gsus4 - G
    Your power, I can do all things.

Chorus:
                  C        Em
   Your name is faithful, eternal,
      F
    merciful and kind.
                Gsus4     G/B
   Your name is loving, gracious—
       Fm6/C               C - E
    it stands the test of time.
       Am              Em
   When I have called upon Your
     Am         Dm
    name, I’ve never had to fear.
         F/G      G
   I can always trust, Lord, in
   C -
    Your name.

2. When the waves of sin and doubt
    – they cover me,
   I kneel down at Your throne,
    and I lay it all before You.
   When the enemy comes at me
    from all sides,
   I call the only name,
    I know that I can trust.

Bridge:
    C   C/E     F- G
   Your name is holy,
   C/E               G - Am - G/B
   Your name brings liberty;
   C/E            F/A     Gsus4 - G
   Your name sets my soul free,
   C/E          F/G - C
   Your name is victory.
