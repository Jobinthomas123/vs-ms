Chorus:
    C                         G
   Stir up a hunger inside of me,
    F                    G     C
   One day Thy face that I may see;
    C          F         G  - Am
   Filling my heart with purity—
   F/G
   Stir up a hunger;
(To Verse: F       C/E- Dm - G)
        (Stir up a hunger.)

    C             G - C
1. Nothing by my ability
    C/E        F6   G       C
   Have I been able to complete;
   C/E          F   G      Am
   Jesus, Your face I now seek.
   C/E        F       G        C
   When I am weak, I bend my knees.
    G              F
   Fill me with strength, Lord,
          C - G/B - Am
    I beseech,
    G  Am     Bb      C/E   F - F/G
   That I may live in victory.

2. Until Thy work, Lord, is complete,
   Lift me up high on hinds’ feet;
   An overcomer I shall be,
   Lord, by Your pow’r
    at work in me.
   Bought with the blood of Calvary,
   I’ve been redeemed,
    and now I’m free.

3. Fire of God, come fall on me;
   Burn away all impurity,
   Cleansing me thoroughly,
   Granting me glorious liberty.
   Son of Thy kingdom,
    You decree—
   Reigning with You eternally.
