 D          D/F#
Burn, burn, Holy Spirit,
 G       D
Burn in me;
                A
Set my soul on fire.
  D     D/F#     G      D
Fill me with the Holy Ghost
 Bm        A      D
And God’s full desire.
 Bm      A          G        D
Make me like the Christ of old—
                         A
Healing and raising the dead;
 D          D/F#        G     D
Give me the power that Jesus had
   Bm         A             D
Through the blood that was shed.
