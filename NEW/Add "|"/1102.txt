Chorus:
               D       A
   We’re going up when Jesus comes,
                D
    We’re going up
                A
     with the chosen ones,
                G
    We’re going up—
        Bm     A     G
     O angels step aside;
             D      A
   Heavenly hosts arise—
       G        A         D
   Receive the raptured bride.

        G                  D
1. The day of Christ will come
        G                 D
   When we will be caught up.
              C                G
   We’ll be clothed in linen white;
         F#m7              A
   The church of God will rise.

2. A mystery unfolds
   When we, the bride, will go;
   Those dead in Christ will rise
   To meet Him in the sky.

3. What feasting will be there
   In the New Jerusalem;
   We’ll walk the streets of gold—
   It’s time for us to go!

4. Spirit and bride say, “Come”;
   The trump begins to sound,
   The Son of God descends
   As the bride of Christ ascends.
