Chorus:
   E       G#m
   Open my eyes
        A      B
   That I may see
          E        G#m
   The things that God
       A         B
   Prepared for me.
            A         E/G#
   I don't want to pretend
            A          C#sus4 - C#
   And lose all in the end
        F#m7     E/G#
   Make eternity real,
   A/C#   B/D#    E
   Oh, so real to me.

     C#m
1. Dreams and loves
       G#m               F#m - G#
   And all my plans seem dear,
       C#m                 G#m
   But these don't mean as much in
              A   B  A/C# - B/D#
    light of what is real.
            E     G#m
   Knowing Jesus Christ,
           Amaj7    B
   Knowing You, my God—
     A     E/G#   F#m - B
   This is truly life.

2. My doubts have
   Only caused me to despair,
   But faith in You now
   Gives me joy beyond compare.
   Knowing Jesus Christ,
   Knowing You, my God—
    This is truly life.

3. Looking for the
   Purpose in my life,
   When I am in Your presence
   You unveil my eyes.
   Knowing Jesus Christ,
   Knowing You, my God—
    This is truly life.

4. I am longing now
   To see Your face,
   Not only when in heaven
   But down here each day.
   Knowing Jesus Christ,
   Knowing You, my God—
    This is truly life.
