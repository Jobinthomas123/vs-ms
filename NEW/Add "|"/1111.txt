F2-        C        F2-     C
1. All my life long  I had panted
           F2
   For a drink from
                Gsus - G
    some cool spring,
     F     C
   That I hoped would
     F2         C
    quench the burning
          Dm7      Gsus-G -C
   Of the thirst I felt within.

Chorus:
    F    C     F       C
   Hallelujah! I have found Him
           Gsus
   Whom my soul
                  G   -G7
    so long has craved!
         C     F       C
   Jesus satisfies my longing;
      F         Am
   Through His blood
       G      C
    I now am saved.

2. Feasting on the husks around me
   Till my strength was almost gone;
   Longed my soul for
    something better,
   Only still to hunger on.

3. Poor I was, and
    sought for riches—
   Something that would satisfy;
   But the dust I gathered round me
   Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.

4. Well of water—ever springing,
   Bread of life, so rich and free,
   Untold wealth that never faileth,
   My Redeemer is to me.
