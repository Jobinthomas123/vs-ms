2. The long, long night is past;
    the morning breaks at last,
   And hushed the dreadful wail
    and fury of the blast.
   As o’er the golden hills
    the day advances fast—
   The Comforter has come!

3. Lo, the great King of kings,
    with healing in His wings,
   To every captive soul
    a full deliv’rance brings;
   And through the vacant cells
    the song of triumph rings:
   The Comforter has come!

4. O, boundless love divine,
    how shall this tongue of mine
   To wond’ring mortals tell
    the matchless grace divine—
   That I, a child of hell,
    should in His image shine?
   The Comforter has come!
