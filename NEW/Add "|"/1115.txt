Chorus:
               D
   It will be worth it all
              Em
    to see my Jesus;
               A
   It will be worth it all
                           D
    just to see His face alone.
       A/D     D
   It will be worth it all
              Em
    to see my Jesus
           G              A
   In His glory and His splendor
              D
    on His throne.

                               D
1. I will walk the streets of heaven
      G          A
    leaping for joy,
     G               A
   Shouting highest praises
     G              D
    to the King of kings.
          Em                 D
   I will give Him all the glory
        G                A
    for all that He has done,
    G             A
   Singing, “Hallelujah!”
        G       A      D
    My joy has just begun!

2. Oh, my heart could ne’er imagine
    what He’s prepared
   For all those who love Him
    throughout eternity.
   But my joy will be to see Him,
    that’s what I’m waiting for;
   Trials will be over—
    I’ll serve Him evermore.
