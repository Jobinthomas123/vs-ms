1. To the work! To the work!

   We are servants of God;
          Gsus4       D7
   Let us follow the paths
             G          G7
   That our Master has trod.
             C
   With the balm of His counsel,

   Our strength to renew;
          Gsus4        D7
   Let us do with our might
             G            G7
   What our hands find to do.

Chorus:
            C           Gsus4 - G
   Toiling on...toiling on.
           Dm-G7-       C
   Toiling on...toiling on.
             -C/E        F -  Dm
   Let us hope, let us watch,
   Ebdim-C/E   Fsus2     C/G-G7 C
   And   labor till the Master comes.

2. To the work! To the work!
   Let the hungry be fed;
   To the fountain of life
   Let the weary be led!
   In the cross and its banner
   Our glory shall be,
   While we herald the tidings,
   “Salvation is free!”

3. To the work! To the work!
   There is labor for all,
   For the kingdom of darkness
   And error shall fall;
   And the name of Jehovah
   Exalted shall be,
   In the loud-swelling chorus,
   “Salvation is free!”

4. To the work! To the work!
   In the strength of the Lord,
   And a robe and a crown
   Shall our labor reward.
   When the home of the faithful
   Our dwelling shall be,
   And we shout with the ransomed,
   “Salvation is free!”
