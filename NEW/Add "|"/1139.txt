I’ve been redeemed.

Who in heav’n above

Is like the Lord?
 A               D
Who is like our God––

The rock of our salvation,
    E                A
The only strong foundation?
     G              D
To whom does He compare?

Magnify the Lord!
Em   A/C#     D
Magnify the Lord!

Holy is our God,

Perfect in all His ways,

Righteous One,

He makes no mistakes.
We bow down,

And lift Him up––
Em   A/C#    D
Magnify the Lord!
