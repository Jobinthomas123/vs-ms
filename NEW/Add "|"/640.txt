Arise, O people of God,
         |B|7
When the enemy is coming
    |E|m
 against you;
     |A|m
Take hold of the shield
           |E|m
 and the sword,
          |F#|
And be strong.
                  |B|7
The Lord is with You.

|A|m             |E|m
He will never leave you;
     |B|7           |E|m    |E|7
His power He has given you.
|A|m             |E|m
He will not forsake you;
            |B|7             |E|m
What Heâ€™s promised He will do.
