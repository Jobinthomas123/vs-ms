    D                   G         D
1. King of my life, I crown thee now;
                     Bm   Em —A
   Thine shall the glory be.
    D         D7
   Lest I forget
          G             D
    Thy thorn-crowned brow,
    Bm         D  A7 D
   Lead me to Cal—va—ry.

Chorus:
    A         A7      D
   Lest I forget Gethsemane,
    A         A7       D
   Lest I forget Thine agony,
             F#m     G         D
   Lest I forget Thy love for me,
    Bm         D  A7 D
   Lead me to Cal—va—ry.

2. Show me the tomb
    where Thou wast laid,
   Tenderly mourned and wept;
   Angels in robes of light arrayed,
   Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

3. May I be willing, Lord, to bear,
   Daily my cross for Thee—
   Even Thy cup of grief to share,
   Thou hast borne all for me.

4. Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire,
   For all who know not Thee;
   Then touch my lips with holy fire,
   To speak of Calvary.
