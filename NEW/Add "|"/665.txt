(Intro: Dm—F—G4—G)
Chorus:
      C     Am     G
   Jehovah God Who reigns,
           F        Dm      C
   Speaks words of peace today;
            Am     G
   Jehovah God Who reigns,
     F       G     C
   Abide in me I pray.

     C                  Em
1. “Peace I leave with you;
               F
   My peace I give,
       F/G                 C
   Not as the world would give
              F
   Give I to you.

   Let not your heart be now,
        Em   Am
    be now afraid.”
         Dm       F
   You spoke and said
                 G — G4 — G
   You’d come again.

2. You called to me by name,
   Told me to come
   And follow in Your way,
   Take up the cross,
   And suffer all the shame, O God;
   Please come renew
    my strength again.

3. O Lord, when I’m afraid,
   I wait on You
   For comfort in my soul.
   It is Your peace,
   That leads me through the storm,
    O God;
   And draws me closer unto You.
