    E         C#m        F#m7
1. Jesus, my Lord, will love me
       B
    forever;
    E          C#m      F#m7
   From Him no power of evil
         B
    can sever.
    E          E7      F#m
   He gave His life to ransom
        A
    my soul;
   F#7              B - Baug
   Now I belong to Him.

Chorus:
    E              E/B B
   Now I belong to Je—sus;
   F#m7     B7       E
   Jesus belongs to me,
    E          E7        F#m
   Not for the years of time
       A
    alone,
    B7            E
   But for eternity.

2. Once I was lost in sin’s
    degradation;
   Jesus came down and
    brought me salvation—
   Lifted me up from sorrow
    and shame.
   Now I belong to Him.

3. Jesus has cleansed me,
    sanctified wholly,
   Spirit and soul and body
    made holy;
   All of my will I’ve yielded to Him.
   Now I belong to Him.

4. Soon Christ will come;
    His bride He will own,
   Forever there with Him on
    His throne.
   His face I’ll see;
    His glory I’ll share.
   Now I belong to Him.
