1. Have you heard tell
    Am               Dm7
    of the wondrous pow’r
              G7
    in Jesus name—
    C                 Am
   How He healed the deaf,
                    Dm7
    the blind, the leper,
             G7
    and the lame?
    C                  Am
   Still He heals the sick today;
         E7           Am
    His Word is ever true!
            D              Dm7
   There’s healing in His name
         G7
    for you!

Chorus:
            C          Am
   Just believe, reach out, the
       Dm                G7
    Great Physician’s standing by.
          C         Am       Dm7
   He’ll hear your call! He longs
                  G7
    to touch and make you whole.
             C
   He’s the same today—just
     C7
    hear Him say,
         F           Fm
   “Come unto Me, believe.”
             C          Am
   And His pow’r will cleanse
         Dm7 G7    C
    and make you whole.

2. You may feel you are not worthy
    of His wondrous grace,
   Cannot come before Him
    and look up into His face.
   Through His sacrifice on Calv’ry
    He has paid your due.
   There’s cleansing in His name
    for you!

3. Standing with a heart of love,
   He calls you to come near.
   Just believe and cast away
    your doubt and all your fear.
   Though your faith is almost gone,
    He will your grace renew.
   There’s power in His name
    for you.

4. Come to Him without delay;
    today you can be free.
   Trust the living Christ;
    He took your pain and agony.
   He’ll be with you now
    and for eternal ages through.
   There’s virtue in His name
    for you.

5. Are you longing for more grace
    to overcome all sin?
   Live a heavenly life and then
    the victor’s crown to win.
   By His stripes He healed your
    body and your spirit, too.
   There’s victory in His name
    for you.
