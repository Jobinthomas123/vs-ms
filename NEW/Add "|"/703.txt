   D          D6      D2
1. I see the signs announcing
           G      Em
    Thy appearing,
           A        A7
   And I yearn to meet
               D
    my loving Lord;
                D6      D2
   I know the crowning day is
              G      Em
    fast approaching,
           A      A7
   As foretold us in
                  D
    Thy precious Word.

Chorus:
          G      Em        A
   How I long to be like Thee,
           D  Bm
    my Master!
          D       Bm
   How I long to meet Thee
             Em - A
    face to face!
             D6        Am7
   Uphold me by Thy strength
          D7      G    Em
    and draw me closer;
             A
   Keep me ever at
    A7              D
    Thy throne of grace.

2. I do abhor this world of sin,
    my Savior,
   Nor its riches do I count as gain;
   For Thou wilt grant Thy child
    a throne forever,
   In Thy kingdom as Thy bride to reign.

3. Oh, keep me faithful in my
    consecration,
   Watchful, zealous,
    striving for the faith,
   Until a host from every tribe
    and nation
   Perfected, Thy coming shall await.

4. Arise, O saints, in light with
    armor gleaming,
   Steadfast to the end
    with courage stand;
   Oh, watch and pray and
    every day redeeming,
   Fight the battle bravely to the end.
