         E          E7
1. All things from God,
                  A    F#m
    they work together,
         B                     E –A/B
   For those who do in love obey;
         E           E7
   All things both small and great
        A    F#m
    He doeth,
  Am   E      B               E –E7
   To work in us His perfect way.

Chorus:
          A       F#m7
   Our lives He worketh out
          E –C#m
    each day
       F#
   To mold and shape us
             B – B7
    in His way;
      E      E7
   Before creation
                A  —F#m
    He hath planned,
  Am   E   B        B7
   On Zion we with Him
             E
    should stand.

2. Although the path be straight
    and narrow,
   And fears within and
    fears without,
   With steadfast hope we drown
    our sorrow,
   And soar above o’er every doubt.

3. When tempests rage and round
    us gather,
   ‘Twill only make our faith
    more strong;
   The wisdom of our loving Father
   Will not permit the storm for long.

4. Whate’er the hand of God
    may offer,
   It cometh from His heart of love;
   On those who never doubt
    and murmur,
   His Spirit broods like gentle dove.

5. What wealth of glory stored
    up yonder
   Beyond the riven veil we see;
   Rare mansions there make saints
    to wonder
   What now we through the
    Word foresee.
