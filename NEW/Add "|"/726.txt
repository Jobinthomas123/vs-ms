   G           Am
1. No one but You, Lord,
        D
   Can satisfy the longing
           G – C/D
    in my heart;
    G        Am
   Nothing I do, Lord,
        D
   Can take the place
         Am     D       G
    of drawing near to You.

Chorus:
   G     Em       C
   Only You can fill
                D      —D/F#
    my deepest longing;
         Em      Am
   Only You can breathe in me
         D4—D
    new life.
        Em        C
   Only You can fill my heart
          D   —D/F#
    with laughter.
         Em     C      D
   Only You can answer my
             G
    heart’s cry.

2. Father, I love You;
   Come satisfy the longing
    in my heart.
   Fill me, overwhelm me,
   Until I know Your love
    deep in my heart.
