1. On Calvary’s tree,  pardon I see;
               G  G/B
   Grace so divine,
                  Am
    flows from a tree.
     C  G        C-C/E     G      Am
   Thy life for mine, my debt to pay,
      A7     Dm7  G              C
   O love divine——how shall I repay?

Chorus:
      G       C       G     Am
   O love divine! Forever mine!
        A7/C#      Dm—G
   Thy life Thou gave,
        G7      C
    my soul to save.
         G     C         G       Am
   What can I give this debt to pay?
       A7/C#  Dm G7             C
   All that I am  to Thee this day.

2. To Thee I give my life, my all,
   To do Thy will, to heed Thy call;
   My life for Thine, a debt of love—
   O love divine,
    flowing from above!
