   Jesus, I love Thee,
    A7       D     Bm7
    O how I love Thee!
             E        E7       A
   Glory to God—from sin I am free!
                 A/C#
   Trusting Thy grace to

    keep me forever,

2. Jesus, I love Thee,
    O how I love Thee!
   Yet ‘tis Thy grace that
    maketh it so;
   Nothing but grace so
    sweetly could move me,
   Giving my heart this
    heavenly glow.

3. Jesus, I love Thee,
    O how I love Thee—
   Love Thee because Thou
    first lovedst me.
   When on the cross my
    faith first beheld Thee
   Dying, from sin my
    soul to make free.

4. Jesus, I love Thee,
    O how I love Thee!
   How could I bear to
    live without Thee?
   Lord, I will trust Thee,
    follow and serve Thee;
   Keep me, O Savior,
    faithful to Thee.
