1. My faith looks up to Thee,
     G           G/B
   Thou Lamb of Calvary,
    C  D   D7 G
   Savior Divine!

   Now hear me while I pray.
   C    C/E  F  C/E  F/C C
   Take all my guilt away;
   F  G       C/E       Am
   O let me from this day
      Dm7  G4  C
   Be wholly Thine.

2. May Thy rich grace impart
   Strength to my fainting heart—
   My zeal inspire.
   As Thou hast died for me,
   O may my love to Thee
   Pure, warm and changeless be
   A liv—ing fire!

3. While life’s dark maze I tread
   And griefs around me spread,
   Be Thou my guide.
   Bid darkness turn to day,
   Wipe sorrow’s tears away,
   Nor let me ever stray
   From Thee aside.

4. When ends life’s transient dream
   When death’s cold sullen stream
   Shall o’er me roll,
   Blest Savior, then, in love,
   Fear and distrust remove;
   O bear me safe above
   A ransomed soul!
