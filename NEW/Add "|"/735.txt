1. Zion, my inheritance,
                      C#m7
   Where the glory of God
         B
    is shining forth;
      E
   Splendor of eternity—
                  C#m7    B
   Highest joy of all the universe.
   C#m  C#m/B      A
   Age to age our God shall reign
              C#m               B4-B
   From His throne of righteousness;
   C#m      C#m/B   A
   Lo, the Lamb on Zion stands
        C#m                  B4—B
   Evermore His name we’ll bless.

Chorus:
    E             A             F#m
   Holy Zion! No tongue can express
            B        B7
   All the wonder untold
            E
    you possess!
      A         B
   Through Your gates
           E B/D# C#m
    shall enter   in
             F#m        B
   Those who lost their lives
        E – E7
    in Him—
    A       B       E   B/D# C#m
   Counting all as loss to  win
          F#m         B       E
   Jesus Christ, the King of kings.

2. There we see on Zion crowned
   Those who humbly bear
    the Father’s name,
   Singing of a life they learned
   As they served their Lord
    in joy and pain.
   These are they who followed Him
   And obeyed His voice alone;
   Holding not their own lives dear,
   Boundless grace
    has led them home.

3. Beautiful upon the mount
   Are the feet of them
    who served the Lord.
   Voices there like waters sound
   As they stand in awe
    before the throne;
   Faithfully they toiled on earth.
   Heaven’s glory to impart—
   Every trial a melody
   Springing forth from Zion’s heart

4. Out of Zion God has shined,
   Seeking those who’ll labor
    at His side;
   Gathering His saints who made
   Covenants of love by sacrifice.
   O, I hear You calling me,
   Your blessed will to do;
   Here am I, please, send me, Lord.
   I’m available to You.
