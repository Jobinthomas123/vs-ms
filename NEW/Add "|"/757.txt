 G              D/F#
God will make a way
               C/E           G/D
  where there seems to be no way.
    C                G/B
He works in ways we cannot see;
 Am7            Cmaj7    D
  He will make a way for me.
G              D/F#
He will be my Guide,
           C/E           G/D
 hold me closely to His side.
      C
With love and strength
     G        Em
 for each new day,
Cmaj7
He will make a way.
Am7      D      G
He will make a way.

G     Eb             F
By a roadway in the wilderness
        Eb  Bb—F/G—Gm
 He’ll lead me,
     Eb            F             G4—G
And rivers in the desert will I see;
 C                     D
Heaven and earth will fade,
         Bm        B/D#      Em
 but His Word will still remain.
C          D                B4—B
He will do something new today.
