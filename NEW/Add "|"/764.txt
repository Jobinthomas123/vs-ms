    |G|                 |G|7
1. I have found His grace
       |C|        |G|
    is all complete;
           |D|        |A|  |D|
   He supplieth ev’ry need.
            |G|       |G|7       |C|      |G|
   While I sit and learn at Jesus’ feet,
          A         A7     D—D7
   I am free, yes, free indeed.

Chorus:
          G      C/G
   It is joy unspeakable
         G
    and full of glory,
    D       D/F#   G
   Full of glory, full of glory.
                 C/G
   It is joy unspeakable
         G
    and full of glory;
           Am7       D7
   Oh, the half has never yet
          G
    been told.

2. I have found the pleasure
    I once craved;
   It is joy and peace within.
   What a wondrous blessing
    I am saved
   From the awful gulf of sin!

3. I have found that hope
    so bright and clear
   Living in the realm of grace.
   Oh, the Savior’s presence
    is so near;
   I can see His smiling face.

4. I have found the joy
    no tongue can tell,
   How its waves of glory roll!
   It is like a great o’erflowing well,
   Springing up within my soul.
