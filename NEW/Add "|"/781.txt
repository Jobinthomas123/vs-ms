1. Once I was weak
          Am             Dm      G
    with no one near to help me.
                  Dm
   All else had failed;
         G          G/B      C
    my heart filled with dismay.

   I cried to Him
       C7
    because my strength
        F         Dm
    had failed me.
                  C-Am
   He strengthened me
          Dm    G         C-C7
    to live by faith each day.

Chorus:
               F
   I trust in God
        Dm     G     Em        Am
    because He never failed me.
                Dm
   I trust His Word
        G                C-C7
    because it’s always true.
               F
   I feel His presence
   Dm  EmAm
    near to reassure me;
                 Dm
   He’ll bear me up
           G               C
    and bring me safely through.


2. There will be times
    when you may feel forsaken;
   All earthly friends
    just helpless stand aside,
   But there is One Who
    promised ne’er to leave you.
   He’ll still be there
    to comfort and to guide.

3. Be not dismayed,
    remember how He loves you;
   Upon the cross
    He suffered cruel pain.
   Those stripes He bore
    bring healing to your body.
   Believe Him now,
   He’ll  heal you and sustain.

4. Take courage child,
    His Spirit now will quicken;
   Reach out in faith,
    believe His gracious Word.
   Hearken to Him,
    He speaks to reassure you,
   To make you whole,
    complete in Him, your Lord.

5. Now you have seen
    His healing touch upon you;
   Go forth and tell
    the world what He has done.
   So others, too,
    may also share His blessing,
   And be made whole
    and live for Him alone.
