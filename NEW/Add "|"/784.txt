    Am    Dm       Em    Am
1. Love flows from Calvary,
            C       Am     Dm
   Reaching out to you and me.
      G
   A ransomed price
        Am
    to save our lives,
    F        G        Am
   Hear Him calling today.

Chorus:
       Am          G   Am
   At Calvary, at Calvary,
    G                         Am
   Sin and death defeated for me!
                  G    Am
   At Calvary, at Calvary,
      G      E-E7
   My Jesus died,
                      Am
    that I might be free!

2. Healing flows from Calvary,
   From sickness setting all men free.
   Body and soul,
   Our Jesus makes whole;
   If we will but trust in His Word.

3. Vict’ry flows from Calvary,
   Conquering every enemy.
   There’s power in His name;
   We’ll not be ashamed.
   By His Spirit we’ll overcome.
