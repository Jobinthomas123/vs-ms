    G          G/B
1. Lord, I’ve heard
          C            Am
    Your voice calling me
        D         D/F#
   To lay down my life
          C          G    —D/G—C/G
    as a living sacrifice,
       G            G7/B
   To count all as loss
            C           Am
    and to follow Your voice,
       G         D       D/F#  G—C
   To labor and live for You alone.

Chorus:
     D     G          G7
   I will answer Your call
        C          Am7
   And forsake my all.
    D            D7
   Counting the cost,
         C             G  —D/G—C/G
   I’ll take up Your cross;
            G            G7/B
   Your reproach I will bear,
             C              Am7
   And Your suffering I’ll share.
          G            D
   Lord, make me Your servant
         G
    evermore.

2. I will go wherever You send
   To rescue the lost
    and work ‘til the end,
   To lose all I have
    and win the great prize,
   To taste and know Your love alone.

3. Then, one day,
    when life’s race is o’er,
   The Savior will say,
    “Come, sit on My throne.
   You’ve left all for Me;
    now yours is the crown.
   Forever you’ll rule and reign
    with Me.”
