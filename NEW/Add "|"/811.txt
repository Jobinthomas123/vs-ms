1. Come, O Lord,
            C        Am
    and revive us again;
    D                    G
   Set all our hearts aflame,
              G7
   Set us on fire;
    C           Am
   That’s our desire.
    D             D7     G  — G7
   Send down the latter rain.

Chorus:
             C     Am7
   Send us a great revival,
           G    Em
   Lasting and eternal.
   D       D7/F#
   We want to see You
    G     C   G
    when You come;
        G7       C        Am7
   Make us all flames of fire,
                G         Em
   Filled with faith and power.
   D         D7/F# G
   We want to overcome.

2. Times of refreshing,
    oh yes, we are waiting.
   Restore the years we’ve lost;
   First love and power
   For this last hour,
   Lord, this is all we want.

3. This is the time of Your visitation;
   This is the final hour.
   Give us a vision
   For that convention
   High above in the sky.

4. Soon You are coming,
    oh what a rejoicing!
   At last, our race will be o’er;
   There no more crying,
   But joy everlasting,
   We’ll serve You evermore.
