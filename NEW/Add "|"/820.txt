The battle belongs to the Lord,
      B               E
The Great and Mighty One,
     G#m             C#m
Who sits upon His throne,
        F#            B
There reigning as the only One
     E                 A
Who conquered sin and death
      B              C#7
That you and I might be
F#m              B
Conquerors with Him
    A    B    E
For all eternity.
