   C       F           G
1. In the heat of the battle
         F        G     C
   When hope is almost gone,
           Em               F
   I will trust my soul to Him
       Dm7                    G
   Who sings love’s sweetest song.

Chorus:
         C
   He’s saying,
     F              G
    “I will not forsake you;
         F            C
   No, never will I leave you.
   F                G
   Do not fear, for I am here;
        F        G        C
   I’ve come to draw you near.”

2. Through each test and each trial
   The hand of God I see;
   I will rest upon His Word,
   And His grace will carry me.

3. Called to walk through
    life’s journey—
   This world is not my home.
   I am waiting for the King
   And His kingdom filled with love.
