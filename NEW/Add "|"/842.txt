Chorus:
            G  D
   In Your presence,
   Em                   C
   That’s where I am strong—
            G  D
   In Your presence,
       Am   G/B C
    O Lord, my God.
             G D
   In Your presence,
    Em               C
   That’s where I belong—
    Em          Bm
   Seeking Your face,
    Em           Bm
   Touching Your grace,
 Am7       G/B          C  G/B   Am
   In the cleft of the Rock—
             D          G
   In Your presence, O God.

  Em         Em/D          C
1. I want to go where the river cannot
    Am7  Bm  G
    overflow me,
              C              D
   Where my feet are on the Rock;
   Em        Em/D            C
   I want to hide where the blazing
         D             G
    fire cannot burn me—
            C           D
   In Your presence, O God.

2. I want to hide where the flood of
    evil cannot reach me,
   Where I’m covered by the blood;
   I want to be where the schemes of
    darkness cannot touch me—
   In Your presence, O God.
