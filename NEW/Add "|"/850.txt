           A
1. Jesus prayed to the Father
            D
    that we all may be one,
           E          D        A
   As the Father and Son are united;

   Join our hearts with Your love,
                D
   Filled with life from above,
             E
   As Your Spirit
                    A
    now binds us together.

Chorus:
            D           E       A
   We will lift up our voice as one
           D      E         A
   As we glorify Godâ€™s own Son;
         D            E
   Holy hands we now raise
           A          F#m
   To the Ancient of Days,
            D        E          A
   Giving glory and honor and praise.

2. As we enter His presence
    with our hearts filled with joy,
   We will worship the Lord
    in the Spirit,
   Giving thanks to His name
   Who is worthy of praise,
   With His power and grace
    flowing through us.
