          E          C#m
1. Holy words long preserved
           F#m           B
   For our walk in this world—
         C#m
   They resound
          B/D#      E
    with God’s own heart;
              A      B       E
   O let the ancient words impart.
            E              C#m
   Words of life, words of hope,
             A                B
   Give us strength, help us cope;
           C#m      B/D#       E
   In this world, where’er we roam,
             A         B        E
   Ancient words will guide us home.

Chorus:
            E           B
   Ancient words ever true,
            F#m           A
   Changing me, changing you—
           C#m       B/D#  E
   We have come with open heart;
             A        B       E
   O let the ancient words impart.

2. Holy words of our faith,
   Handed down to this age,
   Came to us through sacrifice;
   O heed the faithful
    words of Christ.
   Holy words long preserved
   For our walk in this world—
   They resound
    with God’s own heart;
   O let the ancient words impart.
