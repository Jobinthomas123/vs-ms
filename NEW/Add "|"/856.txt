          G
1. I’ve a home prepared
              C       G
    where the saints abide,
                           D
   Just over in the glory land;
         G
   And I long to be
           C        G
    by my Savior’s side,
                      D    G
   Just over in the glory land.

Chorus:
        G
   Just over in the glory land
         C                    G
   I’ll join the happy angel band—
                           D
   Just over in the glory land.
        G
   Just over in the glory land,
          C
   There with the mighty host
          G
    I’ll stand—
                      D    G  -C-G
   Just over in the glory land.

2. I am on my way
    to those mansions fair,
   Just over in the glory land;
   There to sing God’s praise
    and His glory share,
   Just over in the glory land.

3. What a joyful thought
    that my Lord I’ll see,
   Just over in the glory land;
   And with kindred saved,
    there forever be,
   Just over in the glory land.

4. With the blood-washed throng
    I will shout and sing,
   Just over in the glory land;
   Glad “hosannas” to
    Christ the Lord and King,
   Just over in the glory land.
