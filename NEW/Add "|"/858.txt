1. O my soul,
      G        D          A-D
    arise and bless your Maker,
       G  D
   For He is
          G                A
    your Master and your Friend.
             D
   Slow to wrath,
         G       D      A
    but rich in tender mercy—
    D           Bm     Em-D
   Worship the Savior, Jesus.

Chorus:
       G       D       F#m     Bm
   And I will sing for all my days
       G        D         A
   Of heaven’s love come down;
          G       D
   Each breath I take
          F#m        Bm
    will speak His praise
      G       D       A
   Until He calls me home.

2. King of grace,
    His love is overwhelming;
   Bread of Life,
    He’s all I’ll ever need,
   For His blood
    has purchased me forever—
   Bought at the cross of Jesus.

3. When I wake,
    I know that He is with me;
   When I’m weak,
    I know that He is strong.
   Though I fall,
    His arm is there to lean on—
   Safe on the Rock of Jesus.

4. Stir in me
    the songs that You are singing;
   Fill my gaze
    with things as yet unseen.
   Give me faith
    to move in works of power,
   Making me more like Jesus.

5. Then one day,
    I’ll see Him as He sees me—
   Face to face,
    the Lover and the loved.
   No more words,
    the longing will be over—
   There with my precious Jesus.
