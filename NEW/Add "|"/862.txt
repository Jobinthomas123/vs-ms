(Key of G)
          C     D        G
1. Jesus, I am resting, resting
           C       D       G
   In the joy of what Thou art;
         C      D         G
   I am finding out the greatness
           C-D    G
   Of Thy loving heart.
              C            G
   Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
            Em     D        C
   And Thy beauty fills my soul;
                    D       G
   For by Thy transforming power,
              C   D    G
   Thou hast made me whole.

Chorus:
          C    D        G
   Jesus, I am resting, resting
           Em      D       G
   In the joy of what Thou art;
         C      D          G
   I am finding out the greatness
          C-D     G
   Of Thy loving heart.

2. O how great Thy
    lovingkindness—
   Vaster, broader than the sea;
   O how marvelous Thy goodness
   Lavished all on me.
   Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved—
   Know what wealth of grace is
    Thine,
   Know Thy certainty of promise,
   And have made it mine.

3. Simply trusting Thee,
    Lord Jesus
   I behold Thee as Thou art,
   And Thy love so pure, so
    changeless
   Satisfies my heart—
   Satisfies my deepest longings,
   Meets, supplies its every need,
   Compasseth me ‘round with
    blessings:
   Thine is love indeed.

4. Ever lift Thy face upon me,
   As I work and wait for Thee.
   Resting ‘neath Thy smile,
    Lord Jesus,
   Earth’s dark shadows flee.
   Brightness of my Father’s glory,
   Sunshine of my Father’s face,
   Keep me ever trusting, resting,
   Fill me with Thy grace.
