    A                  E
1. What can I offer in thanks
               F#m
    to You, my Lord,
   D                     Bm7
   For all the mercy and favor
                         A-E
    You’ve poured out on me?
          F#m         B7
   You’ve rescued my soul.
          E
   Your blood has cleansed and
     A
    made me whole.
       D                  E       A
   I praise You for Your hand on me.

Chorus:
    C#7  C#/F F#m
   You’re My  Glory;
              B  B/D#       E
   You’re the Lifter of my head.
            A                   D
   By Your love I’ve been set free;
          E              A
   You’re all I’ll ever need.
             F#m            D
   My Strong Tower and my Friend;
         E                 A
   I’ll serve You till the end.

2. As far as the east from the west,
    You’ve removed my sins—
   Cast in the sea to never be
    remembered again.
   You lifted me out
   Of the deep and miry clay;
   A new song flows within my
    heart.

3. Keep me, O Savior, faithful and
    true to You.
   Help me to walk in the light of
    Your shining face.
   Please, try me, O Lord;
   Search my heart and know my
    thoughts,
   And keep me in Your ways,
    O Lord.
