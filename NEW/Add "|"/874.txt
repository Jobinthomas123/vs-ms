   C          G
1. We are a moment;
     Dm        Am
    You are forever—
    F           C
   Lord of the ages,
     Bb        G
    God before time.
    C        G
   We are a vapor;
     Dm      Am
    You are eternal—
    F        C
   Love everlasting,
     Bb          G4 – G
    reigning on high.

Chorus:
   Am     F     C           G
   Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty;
   Am     F       C
   Worthy is the Lamb
              G
    Who was slain.
   Am        F      C            G
   Highest praises, honor, and glory
  Dm    Am      G4 - G
   Be unto Your name,
  Dm    Am      G4 - G
   Be unto Your name.

2. We are the broken;
    You are the Healer—
   Jesus, Redeemer,
    mighty to save.
   You are the love song
    we’ll sing forever,
   Bowing before You,
    blessing Your name.
