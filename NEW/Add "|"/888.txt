Chorus:
    A           D      E          A
   You are the Potter; I am the clay.
                  D
   You’re the Refiner;
    G                E
    Lord, have Your way.
    D         E      A           F#m
   Make me a vessel fit for Your use;
    D         E
   Make me a vessel
           D    E   A
    that glorifies You.

   G
1. Change me, Lord;
        D           A
    I yield now to You.
   F#m             E            A
   My desire’s to be just like You.
    G
   Cleanse me, Lord;
         D                A
    let Your life flow through—
   G              D         E
   I would be a channel for You.

2. Fill me, Lord,
    with Your life anew;
   Lord, give me a heart that is true.
   Use me, Lord,
    Your will I would do;
   Teach me how to live just for You.
