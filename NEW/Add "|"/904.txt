    G
1. Standing on the promises

    of Christ my King,
    C
   Through eternal ages
              G
    let His praises ring;

   Glory in the highest

    I will shout and sing,
    C                D7         G
   Standing on the promises of God.

Chorus:
    G   G7    C    Am
   Standing, standing,
   D                D7
   Standing on the promises
        G   C   G  D
    of God my Savior;
    G   G7    C    Am
   Standing, standing,
         G
   I’m standing on the
      D7         G
    promises of God.

2. Standing on the promises
    that cannot fail,
   When the howling storms of doubt
    and fear assail;
   By the living Word of God
    I shall prevail,
   Standing on the promises of God.

3. Standing on the promises
    I now can see
   Perfect, present cleansing
    in the blood for me;
   Standing in the liberty
    where Christ makes free,
   Standing on the promises of God.

4. Standing on the promises
    of Christ the Lord,
   Bound to Him eternally
    by love’s strong cord;
   Overcoming daily
    with the Spirit’s sword,
   Standing on the promises of God.

5. Standing on the promises
    that cannot fall,
   List’ning every moment
    to the Spirit’s call;
   Resting in my Savior
    as my All in all,
   Standing on the promises of God.
