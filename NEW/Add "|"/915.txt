1. Blest be the God
         G          A        D
    of heav’n and earth and sea—
      A/C#  Bm7        E    A4 -A
   He Who inhabiteth eternity.
        D       G
   The God of truth,
         D   Bm7   A4 -A
    without iniquity,
     F#/A#   Bm-Bm/A
   I bow and worship,
    G       A   D4 -D
    O most Holy One.

2. Most precious Lord,
    there is no other name
   Under the heav’ns
    whereby we can be saved.
   Jesus, the One
    from age to age the same;
   Great God and Savior,
    our Emmanuel.

3. O Israel, behold
    Messiah, your King.
   Thou dying Gentile race,
    arise and sing!
   In every ear,
    creation’s song will ring
   In one accord
    that Jesus is the Lamb.

4. Thy holy Word
    is filled with truth and grace;
   Let “Yea” and “Amen”
    now complete our days.
   Send out Thy light;
    build truth in every race.
   “Let it be done!”
    thus saith the Lord of hosts.

5. He sits as King
    upon the throne divine.
   God only wise,
    this glory all be Thine!
   Through endless days,
    You rule in power sublime;
   Thy kingdom come,
    and let Thy will be done.
