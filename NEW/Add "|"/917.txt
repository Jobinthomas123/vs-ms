            A        A/C#
1. For the glory of heaven,
             D      E      A
    I have counted all as loss—
           F#m       C#m
   For the love of my Savior
         D        D/E         E
    Who died upon Calv’ry’s cross.
            A           A/C#
   For the One Who has called me
       D       C#   F#m
    to be for Him alone,
           D               A
   I will give my life in service,
     Bm7       E       A
    until He takes me home.

Chorus:
               D   -E
   Oh, what a love
                   A       -F#m
    that You have given me;
               Bm  -E
   Oh, what a love
                   A       A7
    that set this sinner free!
                   D   -E/D
   I’ll serve You now
                 C#m -F#m
    and through eternity;
           D
   My dear Jesus,
       E                  A
    I love You more than all.

2. Oh, the glory of heaven
    is the presence of the Lord—
   Where His face shines in beauty,
    His holiness to be adored.
   There we’ll reign with the Father
    and the Lamb upon His throne;
   We will serve our King forever
    in our eternal home.
