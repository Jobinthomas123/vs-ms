We worship You in this sanctuary.
            Bm   Em         A
We give our hearts to You alone;
           D    Em
For You, O Lord,
             D/F#   G
 are, oh, so worthy,
           Bm
And now our praise
     Em   G/A       D
 is lifted to Your throne.


    D/F#     G
For all the blessings
          A
 You have given
         Bm                F#m
And Your faithfulness each day,
        G               A
We will never cease to praise You
          Bm              F#m
For the remainder of our days;
D/F#     G              A
That is why we all are gathered
    Bm     A     E/G#
To lift up holy praise,
            Em   G/A
And now we singâ€”
