Chorus:
      E                C#m
   I surrender; I will render
         F#m        A
   Every part of my heart
           Bsus - B/D#
   To You alone.
       Emaj7       B/D#  C#m
   Not withholding even one thing—
            A               B
   For Your call, I give my all,
        E2   E
   I am Your own.

        A       C#m
1. When I can’t see
        A
   The pathway ahead of me,
                     C#m
   I know that I can trust You
         B4   -B/D#
    and obey.
             C#m               A
   When the choice is Yours to make,
             B         E
   There can be no mistake;
        F#m              A
   So I place my hand in Yours:
                B
   You lead the way.

2. The things held near
   To my heart that seem so dear,
   I hear Your call to bring them
    all to You.
   Let my heart be fully free
   To love You totally;
   Even now I lay them all
   Down at Your feet.
