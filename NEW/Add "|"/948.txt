   E            E/G#
1. Sweet is the promise:
    B              E
    “I will not forget thee;”
   F#m         C#m
   Nothing can molest
       A       F#   B4
    or turn my soul away.
   E               E/G#     A
   E’en though the night be dark
               C#m
    within the valley,
   A               F#m
   Just beyond is shining
     B B/D#    E
    an eternal day.

Chorus:
   E F#m         E/G#
   I   will not forget thee
          A
    or leave thee.
   B                B/D#
   In My hands I’ll hold thee;
   E/G#            A
   In My arms I’ll fold thee.
  E-A        E/G#
   I will not forget thee
        Am
    or leave thee.
   E        A
   I am thy Redeemer;
   B        B/D#     E
    I will care for thee.

2. How can I show my gratitude
    to Jesus,
   For His love unfailing
    and His tender care?
   I will proclaim to others
    His salvation,
   That they may accept Him
    and His promise share.

3. Trusting the promise:
    “I will not forget thee,”
   Onward will I go with
    songs of joy and praise;
   Though earth despise me,
    though my friends forsake me,
   Jesus will be near me,
    gladdening my days.

4. When at the golden portals
    I am standing,
   All my tribulations,
    all my sorrows past;
   How sweet to hear
    the blessed proclamation:
   “Enter, faithful servant;
    welcome home at last!”
