Chorus:
              E      B        E
   I will be ready when You call;
                  E/G#
   Lord, by Your grace
                 B
    I’ve been forgiven,
                E      B      C#m
   And You’ll deliver me from all
        B       A
   My sins and failures—
                 B  A
   So when You call
              E
   I will be ready.

           B               A
1. You’re raising up each valley
        A/C#              E
   And exalting Christ in me.
         B
   The prideful mountains—
      A
    bring them down;
      D              D/F# - B
   Replace them with humility.

2. The crooked shall be straightened,
   All dishonesty removed,
   Rough places changed
    to gentleness—
   Lord, less of me and more of You.

3. Your glory soon revealing
   What Your grace has done in me,
   Then I will lift
    Your name up high
   And praise You through eternity.
