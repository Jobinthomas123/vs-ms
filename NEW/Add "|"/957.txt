Lord, I believe

Every promise,

               A - E
In complete surrender.

I embrace Your truth;
   A    B    E
O Lord, I believe.

  A                B             E
Just a grain of faith is all I need

To see miracles

 if I will just believe.
  A               B
Fill me anew, O Spirit Divine;
        G#m7         C#m7
Breathe faith in me one more time,

O Lord, that I may believe.
