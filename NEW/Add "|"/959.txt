   Am
1. The mighty Lord of hosts
        G
   Has gone out to war;
         F
   The victory and battle
       E
   Are in His hands.
                Am
   Though the enemy has come
      G
   Against us like a flood,
           F
   He’ll flee at the sound
           E
   Of the Captain’s command!

Chorus:
   Am
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   Am/G
   Who will go to war?
   Am/F
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   E                         E7
   Who will take up their sword?
   Am
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   Am/G
   Who will go to war?
   Am/F
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   E                    E7
   To thrust out the enemy—
                 Am
   Our defeated foe.

2. We’re a chosen generation;
   He’s called us to fight,
   To bring every work
   Of darkness to light.
   Through our God
   We shall do valiantly;
   We’ll run through a troop
   And sweep o’er our enemies.
