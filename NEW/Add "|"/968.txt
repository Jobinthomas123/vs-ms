(Key of C)
   Am      G/B     C
1. Oh, to see the dawn
             Dm     C/E
    of the darkest day:
   F              C/E     Dm  F/C G/B
   Christ on the road to Cal——va——ry.
   Am        G/B     C
   Tried by sinful men,
               Dm      C/E
    torn and beaten, then
   F            C/E  F  Gsus - G/F
   Nailed to a cross of wood.

Chorus:
   C/E        F    G/B      C
   This, the power of the cross:
   C/E       F   G/B     C
   Christ became sin for us,
   C/E         F   D/F#        G
   Took the blame, bore the wrath—
   G/F  C/E     F   C/G        C
   We stand forgiven at the cross.

2. Oh, to see the pain
    written on Your face,
   Bearing the awesome
    weight of sin.
   Ev’ry bitter thought,
    ev’ry evil deed,
   Crowning Your blood-stained brow.

3. Now the daylight flees,
    now the ground beneath
   Quakes as its Maker
    bows His head.
   Curtain torn in two,
    dead are raised to life;
   Finished the vict’ry cry.

4. Oh, to see my name
    written in the wounds,
   For through Your suffering
    I am free.
   Death is crushed to death,
    life is mine to live,
   Won through Your selfless love.

Chorus 2:
   This, the power of the cross:
   Son of God slain for us.
   What a love, what a cost!
   We stand forgiven at the cross.
