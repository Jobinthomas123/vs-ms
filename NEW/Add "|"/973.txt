1. There's a hope in my heart
          C
    each day,
         G          Em        A-D
   For soon I will see Jesus' face.
           Em/B
   Though darkness
                   C
    and troubles abound,
                        G
   And fears are all around;
             C                G
   There's rest in my soul today
           A             D
   'Cause I hear Jesus say...

Chorus:
                  G
   Lift up your head;

    redemption is nigh.

   Lift up your head;
          A              D
    I am coming for My bride.
             G         C
   One day soon I'll appear
       Em            C
   And rapture you away.
                 G
   Lift up your head;
            C/D       D    G
    your redemption draws nigh.

2. The pleasures of life will fade,
   But one thing will always remain:
   Through storms
    and strong tempests of life
   And all throughout the nights,
   God's promises never changeâ€”
   His Word is still the same.

3. Every trial we face down here
   Is a sign that His coming is near;
   So joyfully we can go on,
   For now it won't be long.
   And He whispers in our ear,
   "My bride, be of good cheer."
