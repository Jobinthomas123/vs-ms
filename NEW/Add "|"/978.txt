Chorus:
    Bm                G
   Jesus, quench my thirst;
                      D
   Hear my desperate cry,
                   F#sus4
   For I know that You,
         F#           Bm
   You alone can satisfy.
                     G
   Nothing else will do;
                  D
   You are my supply.
                 F#sus4
   All I need is You;
         F#           Bm (for verse: G)
   You alone can satisfy.

  (G)      D           A
1. As the deer panteth for the brooks
          Bm            Am      G
   So my soul thirsteth after Thee.
           D
   I have tasted and I know
          A
    that You are good,
          F#                      Bm
   But I long to all Your fulness see.

2. There is not anything on earth
   Nor in all of the heav'n above
   I desire; there is just one thing I
    askâ€•
   To have You alone, the One I
    love.
