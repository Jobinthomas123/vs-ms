Chorus:
   Dm
   In Your glory shine.

   In Your glory shine;
                    A7      Dm
   Let Your beauty shine on us
    Bb           Dm
   Bringing restoration.
    Gm            Dm
   Shine into our darkness
    C                Dm
   With the light of Zion—
    Gm           Dm
   Granting us deliverance;
   A7             Dm
   You are our salvation.

   Gm           Dm
1. Our God has spoken
    A            Dm
   From His holy mountain,
 Gm-       Dm
   Sending forth
 A-               A7
   His truth and light.

2. Fire goes before Him
   Shining out of Zion—
   Righteous Judge
   Over His saints.

3. Our God is calling
   Unto all His saints—
   Gath’ring those
   Who’ve been found true.

Bridge:
    Gm          Dm
   Shine out of Zion;
     A           Dm-D7
   Shine into my life.
    Gm          Dm
   Shine out of Zion;
     A
   Shine into my life.
