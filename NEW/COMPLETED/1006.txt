|D|                 |A|        |B|*m*
We fall down; we lay our crowns
          |G|      |A|
 at the feet of Jesus.
       |D|          |A|         |B|*m*
The greatness of mercy and love—
          |G|      |A|
 at the feet of Jesus.

*Chorus:*
              |G|    |D|*/*|F#|  |E|*m*
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy.”
              |G|    |D|*/*|F#|  |E|*m*
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy.”
              |G|    |D|*/*|F#|  |E|*m*
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy
 |A|       |D|
 is the Lamb.”
