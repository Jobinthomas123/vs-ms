*1.* Son of God—
    |G|               |A|
    holy, righteous One,
                |D|
   You knew no sin,
            |E|*m*                |A|
    yet for me You bled and died.
            |B|*m*
   A cruel price—
                 |A|          |E|*m*
    You bore the agony and shame
          |D|*/*|F#|               |G|*/*|A|
   For my soul the precious Lamb
                 |A|
    of God was slain!

*Chorus:*
   |D|             |G|          |A|
   Here at Your feet, Lord Jesus,
      |D|        |G|       |A|
   I give You all my praise.
       |D|            |G|
   My sins You've washed,
       |A|        |B|*m*
   My sickness healed
            |G|            |A|      |B|*m*
   By the blood You've shed for me.
     |G|        |A|        |B|*m*
   Thank You for Your love!
     |G|        |A|        |D|
   Thank You for Your love!

*2.* Lord of lords,
    Your glory fills this place.
   Angels bow;
    elders cast their golden crowns
   At Your feet
   Your glory floods my soul
   And I rejoice as Your beauty
    I behold!

*Bridge:*
       |D|               |A|
   For me the Lamb of God was slain
       |B|*m7*
   That I might live
          |A|               |G|
    and reign with Him forever!
       |D|
   My sins are washed,
        |A|
    and I am healed!
        |B|*m7*
   Oh, Lamb of God,
           |F#|*m*
    You've set me free;
    |G|              |A|
   Jesus, I will praise Your name
       |E|*m*
    forever!
