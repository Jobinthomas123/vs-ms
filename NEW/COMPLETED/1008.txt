   Fullness divine in Thee I see,
    |G|*/*|D|       |D|     |D|*7*    |G|

   Has won my heart from me,
         |G|  |B|*7–*|C|        |G|

   Crucified Jesus lifted up,
   Bearing our guilt and misery—

   Shedding His blood
    to make us free—
   Merciful Man of Calvary!

    obtained for men,
   Pouring out love beyond our ken,
   Giving us spotless purity—
   Bountiful Man of Calvary!

   Jesus, I’ll meet Thee
    some sweet day;
   Center of glory, Thee I’ll see,
   Wonderful Man of Calvary!

*6.* Gathered with Thee eternally,
   Sharing Thy love by glassy sea,
   Like Thee forever I shall be,
   Glorified Man of Calvary!
