   Yahweh, our Deliverer,
        |A|*7*               |D|*m-*|Bb|*-*|C|
    we lift our eyes to You.

           |A|*m*       |D|*m*
    Comforter You remain.

   All our hope is in You, our God.

*2.* When the battle is long
    and the enemy’s strong,
   You will fight
    for Your chosen ones.

*3.* Through the storm You will be
    home and shelter to me,
   And Your rainbow will still
    be seen.

*4.* Though our loved ones may flee,
    ‘til the end You will be
   Faithful, covenant-keeping God.

*5.* In the end we’ll be there
    in Jerusalem fair,
   Evermore with the God we love.
