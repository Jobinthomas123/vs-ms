         |4|               |11|*7*
When I think of the goodness
     |4|
 of Jesus,

When I think of what
       |1|*m*     |6|*m—*|11|
 He’s done for me,
         |4|         |4|*7*
Then my soul cries out,
        |9| *—* |6|*m*
 “Hallelujah!
        |4|       |11|*7*     |4|
Praise God for saving me.”
