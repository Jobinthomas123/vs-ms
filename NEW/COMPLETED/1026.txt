        |C|          |F|
*1.* In shady green pastures,
      |E|*m*           |A|*m7*
   So rich and so sweet,
        |D|*m*              |G|        |C|
   God leads His dear children along.
    |F|*/*|G|       |C|           |D|*m*
   Where the waters cool flow
               |E|*m*         |A|*m7*
   Bathes the weary one’s feet
        |D|*m*              |G|        |C|
   God leads His dear children along.

*Chorus:*
                     |C|*/*|E|
   Some through the waters,
    |F|                 |C|
   Some through the flood,
                    |A|*m7*
   Some through the fire,
       |D|*7*                |G|*7*
   But all through the blood.
    |C|                  |C|*/*|E|
   Some through great sorrow,
        |F|           |C|
   But God gives a song
                 |A|*m7*
   In the night season
        |D|*m*      |G|   |C|
   And all the day long.

*2.* Sometimes on the mount
   Where the sun shines so bright,
   God leads His dear children along.
   Sometimes in the valley
   In darkest of night,
   God leads His dear children along.

*3.* Though sorrows befall us
   And Satan oppose,
   God leads His dear children along.
   Through grace we can conquer,
   Defeat all our foes–
   God leads His dear children along.

*4.* Away from the mire
   And away from the clay,
   God leads His dear children along.
   Away up in glory
   Eternity’s day
   God leads His dear children along.
