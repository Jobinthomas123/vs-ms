             |G|
*1.* Let our praise arise
              |E|*m*
    from this temple;
          |A|*m*         |D|     |G|
   Let it fill this holy place.
                       |E|*m*

   The Lion of Judah
            |D|          |E|*m*
    shall break every chain.
     |G|          |C|

   Rising from the church today.
   And we know our King is coming;
   Our God forever reigns!

   He’s the King of kings
            |D|      |E|*m*
   And the Lord of lords.
            |G|*/*|B|    |C|
   He’s the mighty One,
           |D|       |G|
   The unchanging God.
