           |E|         |A|*/*|E|
*1.* To the river I am going
             |E|            |B|*/*|E|
   Bringing sins I cannot bear.
              |E|
   Come and cleanse me,
            |A|
   Come forgive me;
            |E|       |B|         |E|
   Lord, I need to meet You there.

*Chorus:*
             |E|           |A|
   Precious Jesus, I am ready
          |E|            |B|
   To surrender ev'ry care.
            |E|
   Take my hand now,
             |A|
   Lead me closer;
            |E|       |B|         |E|
   Lord, I need to meet You there.

*2.* In these waters healing mercy
   Flows with freedom from despair.
   I am going to that river;
   Lord, I need to meet You there.

*3.* Come and join us in the river;
   Come find life beyond compare.
   He is calling, He is waiting;
   Jesus longs to meet you there.
