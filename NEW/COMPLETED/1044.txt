         |D|     |G|*/*|A|    |D|       |B|*m*
*1.* There is a name I love to hear;
     |E|*m*       |A|        |D| *-* |G|*/*|A|
   I love to sing its worth.
        |D|         |F#|*7/*|C#|*-*|B|*m*   |A|*m*
   It sounds like music in my ear–
    |D|   |G|*-*|D|*/*|F#| |E|*m*  |G|*/*|A|      |D|
   The swe–e–test name on earth.

*Chorus:*
   |D|   |G|*/*|A|         |D|*-*|B|*m*
   Oh, how I love Jesus.
 |E|*7-*|A|               |D| *-*|G|*/*|A|
    Oh, how I love Jesus.
   |D|   |F#|*7*        |B|*m*
   Oh, how I love Jesus
     |E|*m-*|D|*/*|F#|*-*|G|   |E|*7*    |A|*7*   |D|
   Because   He first loved me.

*2.* It tells me of a Savior's love
   Who died to set me free.
   It tells me of His precious blood–
   The sinner's perfect plea.

*3.* It tells of One
   Whose loving heart
   Can feel my deepest woe,
   Who in my sorrow bears a part
   That none can bear below.

*4.* It bids my trembling heart rejoice
   And dries each rising tear;
   It tells me in a still small voice
   To trust and never fear.

*5.* Jesus, the name I love so well,
   The name I love to hear.
   No saint on earth
   Its worth can tell;
   No heart conceive how dear.

*6.* And there with all the
   Blood-bought throng,
   From sin and sorrow free,
   I’ll sing the new eternal song
   Of Jesus’ love to me.
