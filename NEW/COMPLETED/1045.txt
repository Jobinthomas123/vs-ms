*(Key of* |E|*)*
      |C#|*m*         |B|
*1.* You see each sparrow
          |A|
    that falls,
       |C#|*m*       |B|*/*|D#|    |E|
   You hear each time I call,
                 |F#|*m*
   Lord, there’s nothing
    |E|*/*|G#|       |B|
    You can’t do
                   |A|
   And though You let
               |E|*/*|G#|
   The sparrows fall,
            |F#|*7*            |B|
   When You let my pain go on,
   |E|*/*|G#|             |F#|*m*
   I’ll know You’re working
      |B|*7*      |E|
   Through it all.

*Chorus:*
   |A|*/*|B|         |E|                    |A|
   Jesus, it’s all a part of Your plan
                   |C#|*m*
   Just like those nails
          |B|             |A|
   They placed in Your hands.
              |C#|*m*
   And when I can’t seem
             |B|*/*|D#|
    to understand,
         |G#|*7*
   You remind me
                    |C#|*m*
   That I’m in Your hands;
    |E|*/*|G#|      |F#|*m*
   So I’ll be still
         |B|            |E|
   And trust in Your will.

*2.* You bore my sorrows
    and griefs,
   You know my every need;
   Lord, there’s nothing
    You can’t do.
   And though You let
   The sorrows come,
   You’re my comfort in each one;
   So I say “Let Your will be done.”

*3.* You turned the water to wine,
   The dead You raised to life;
   Lord, there’s nothing
    You can’t do.
   You’ll turn my mourning into joy;
   In this promise I rejoice.
   Therefore in praise I lift my voice.
