*1.* Many years have passed
        |D|*m*
   Since I began this race,
       |A|*m*
   But it has not been easy
   |D|*m*    |E|*7*
   On my own.
       |A|*m*
   Oh what would I have done
       |D|*m*
   Without His saving grace?
   |F|*9*                 |E|*7*
   All the praise to Him!

*Chorus:*
       |A|*m*
   Oh, Jesus!
                        |D|*m7*
   I want to live for Jesus,
                       |F|*maj7*
   I want to stand for Jesus,
      |E|*m*          |A|*m*
   I want to overcome!

*2.* Many, many times
   I’ve failed to do my part.
   How many, many times
   I’ve compromised.
   So many, many times
   I grieved God’s broken heart;
   I desire to change.

*3.* When temptation comes,
   I know I cannot stand.
   My confidence has gone;
   I know I’ll fail,
   But when the Lord upholds me
   By His strength I’ll stand.
   Glory to His name!

*4.* He is known as Alpha,
   God Who heals my past.
   And He’s the One Who
   Leads me day by day.
   And He is Omega,
   He’ll lead me to the last;
   He’s the great I Am!

*5.* The battle rages on
   Against His chosen ones;
   The army of the Lord
   Must stand and fight.
   The weakest will be strong,
   The enemy will run;
   Rise and let us go!
