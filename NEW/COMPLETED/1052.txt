   |C|
I can’t stop singing,

And I can’t stop shouting
                        |G|
Since the power fell on me.

I can’t stop singing,

And I can’t stop shouting;
               |C|
Jesus set me free.

The Spirit came

With tongues of fire
           |C|*7*   |F|
And rested upon me;
   |D|*m*
I can’t stop singing,
      |E|*m*           |A|*m*
And I can’t stop shouting
           |D|*m*    |G|       |C|
Since the power fell on me.
