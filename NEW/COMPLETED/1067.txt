*1.* In communion with my Lord
       |C|                |G|
   I bring to Him each care.
         |C|              |G|*/*|B|
   My troubles, all my burdens
       |A|*7*               |D|*7*
   I know that He will bear.
          |G|               |G|*7*
   God’s Word gives me assurance
          |C|               |G|
   That Jesus hears my prayer;
       |C|               |G|*/*|B|
   I find that I am strengthened
   |E|*m*     |A|*m*      |D|*7*       |G|
   As I leave my burdens there.

*Chorus:*
           |E|*m*
   Oh what fellowship
                 |G|
    I have with Jesus!
              |E|*m*        *-*|A|*7*
   A wondrous fellowship–
              |D|
    this my peace.
                 |A|*m    -*|C|
   This sweet communion
          |G|*/*|B|   *-*|E|*m*
    satisfies me;
          |A|*m*       *-*|D|         |G|
   Jesus’ presence is all I need.

*2.* In communion with my Lord
   His presence is so real;
   What joy I have in knowing
   That Jesus is so near.
   For all my doubts and questions
   His answer is my peace.
   I rest in Jesus’ presence,
   For He meets my every need.

*3.* In communion with my Lord
   I’m walking every day.
   It’s Jesus Who is guiding
   Me in this narrow way.
   No enemy can touch me;
   With Jesus I am safe.
   And I will never wander
   If I trust Him and obey.

*4.* In communion with my Lord
   His glory I do see;
   And by the Spirit’s power
   Christ’s image will be seen.
   He whispers, “Cease your striving;
   Surrender now to Me.
   My work will be accomplished
   As you’re seated at My feet.”
