*(Key of* |D|*m)*
*Chorus:*
   |D|*m* |G|*m*   |C|                 |F|
   Zi—on city of the great King;
           |Bb|     |C|
   I have set my King
          |Bb|            |A|
   On the holy hill of Zion.
   |D|*m* |G|*m*   |C|                |F|
   Zi—on city of the great King;
           |Bb|     |C|
   I have set my King
         |A|    |D|*m*
   On my holy hill.

          |D|*m*
*1.* God's chosen habitation,
       |G|*m*
   The joy of every nation,
         |D|*m*        |C|     |Bb|    |A|
   God's resting place eternally.
        |D|*m*
   From here the law proceedeth,
       |G|*m*
   All beauty is perfected
       |Bb|         |A|
   Our God doth shine on you
        |D|*m*
    and me.

*2.* All blessings flow from Zion,
   The singers and musicians
   All sing a song that none can sing.
   They stood for consecration
   Enjoyed His full redemption;
   From man and earth
    they were set free.

*3.* All praises go to Zion,
   What blessed revelations
   Of things unseen, unheard by men.
   A city pure and holy
   For saints who were made worthy
   To enter in within the veil.

*4.* Yes, let us praise and worship
   Our God Who is exalted
   Above all things in sky and sea.
   All glory, laud, and honor
   To Him Who lives forever,
   All power to our glorious King!

*5.* Oh glory, hallelujah!
   He cometh— Maranatha!
   Oh praise the Lord,
   Let's shout and sing
   To God who reigns from Zion;
   Extol Him all creation,
   And worship at His holy hill.
