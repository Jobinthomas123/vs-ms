     |C|*/*|E|               |A|*m*
*1.* I hear the voice of Jesus,
   |F|               |G|*/*|B|
   Oh so sweet and clear—
    |D|*m*                 |E|*7(b9)*
   Words of peace and comfort
   |A|*m7*             |C|*9*
   Whispered in my ear.
        |F|             |D|*m*
   He tells me He can do
       |E|*m*              |A|*m*
   Anything He chooses to,
        |F|          |C|
   And yet He reassures me
        |D|*m*            |C|*9*
   He won’t let go of me.

*Chorus:*
             |F|*maj7*
   Sovereign Lord,
         |D|*m*             |E|*m*
   You hold me in Your hand.
       |F|                |C|
   My life is in Your hand;
              |G| *–* |C|*9*
   Here I’ll stay.
            |F|
   And I’m safe
             |G|*/*|F|              |C|*/*|E|
   No matter what may come my way
               |F|             |A|*m*
   Cause there is no better place
                 |D|*m*
   Than in Your plan
          |F|*/*|G|              |F| *–* |C|
   In the hollow of Your hand.

*2.* I hear the voice of Jesus
   This is how I know
   I am my Beloved’s;
   I’m His very own.
   He shelters me each day;
   Jesus is my hiding place,
   And what a joy to know I’m
   The apple of His eye.

*3.* I hear the voice of Jesus,
   And now I can see
   Visions of my homeland
   In eternity.
   My destiny is sure,
   For in Jesus I’m secure;
   I’ll stay within my Lord’s hand
   And safely reach that land.
