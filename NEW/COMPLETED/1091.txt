*2.* Bring your empty earthen vessels,
   Clean thro' Jesus' precious blood.
   Come, ye needy, one and all,
   And in human consecration
   Wait before the throne of God,
   'Til the Holy Ghost shall fall.

*3.* Like the cruse of oil unfailing
   Is His grace forevermore,
   And His love unchanging still;
   And according to His promise
   With the Holy Ghost and pow'r,
   He will ev'ry vessel fill.
