*1.* Father, we are waiting here
        |A| *-*
    for  You;
    |B|*m*
   Come and overwhelm us
               |E|*m*
    with Your love.
        |D|
   Surround us with Your glory
          |A| *-*
    now we pray;
    |B|*m*
   Draw us nearer to
                  |E|*m*
    Your secret place.

*Chorus:*
            |G|       |A|
   May we abide in You,
    |B|*m*
   Keep our hearts from
               |G|
    wandering away.

   May we remain
                     |A|
    hidden in Your grace,
      |B|*m*
   Forever in Your perfect
               |G|
    peace to stay.

*2.* Jesus, come and cleanse
    our lives today;
   Purify us, Lord,
    now with Your fire.
   O holy God, break our hearts
    for our sins,
   Mold us to Your good
    and perfect will.

*Bridge:*
    |B|*m*
   Holy Spirit speak,
     |A|
   Call unto the deep,
     |B|*m*          |F#|*m*
   Drawing us to You, Lord;
    |G|
   Father, hear our plea
    |A|
   For our greatest need
   |E|*m*             |A|
   Is that we be holy.
