 |4|         |6|*m*
Wherever I am,
        |11|
 I’ll praise Him.
            |9|
Whenever I can,
        |4|
 I’ll praise Him,
         |9|         |4|
For His love surrounds me
 |6|        |11|
 like the sea.
                 |9|       |4|
I’ll praise the name of Jesus,
             |8|       |1|*m*
Lift up the name of Jesus,
         |6|*m*      |11|*7*
For the name of Jesus
         |4|
 lifted me.
