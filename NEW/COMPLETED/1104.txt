               |G|
*1.* There’s a country far beyond

    the starry sky;
              |D|*7*
   There’s a city where there
                    |G|
    never comes a night.
              |C|
   If we’re faithful we shall go there
           |G|
    by and by;
            |A|*m*              |D|*7*
   'Tis the city where the Lamb
            |G|
    is the light.

*Chorus:*
            |G|              |C|*/*|D|
   In that city where the Lamb
            |G|
    is the light,
      |E|*m*                |A|*7*
   The city where there cometh
         |D|
    no night.
            |C|
   I will dwell with Jesus there,
             |G|                  |E|*m*
   And when free from toil and care,
         |A|*m*              |D|*7*
   I am going where the Lamb
 |G|
    is the light.

*2.* Here we have our days
    of sunshine, but we know
   That the sun which shines upon us
    now so bright,
   Will be changed to clouds and rain
    until we go
   To the city where the Lamb
    is the light.

*3.* There the flowers bloom
    forever and the day
   Shall be one eternal day
    without a night;
   And our tears shall be
    forever wiped away,
   In that city where the Lamb
    is the light.

*4.* Here we have our disappointments
    all the while,
   And our fondest hopes but meet
    with bitter blight.
   Tho’ by night we weep,
    the morning brings a smile,
   In that city where the Lamb
    is the light.

*5.* Then let sunlight fade,
    let twilight bring its gloom,
   Not a shadow can my blissful
    soul affright;
   For I know that up in heaven
    there is room,
   In that city where the Lamb
    is the light.
