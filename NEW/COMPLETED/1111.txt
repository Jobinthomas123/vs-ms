|F|*2-*        |C|        |F|*2-*     |C|
*1.* All my life long  I had panted
           |F|*2*
   For a drink from
                |G|*sus -* |G|
    some cool spring,
     |F|     |C|
   That I hoped would
     |F|*2*         |C|
    quench the burning
          |D|*m7*      |G|*sus-*|G| *-*|C|
   Of the thirst I felt within.

*Chorus:*
    |F|    |C|     |F|       |C|
   Hallelujah! I have found Him
           |G|*sus*
   Whom my soul
                  |G|   *-*|G|*7*
    so long has craved!
         |C|     |F|       |C|
   Jesus satisfies my longing;
      |F|         |A|*m*
   Through His blood
       |G|      |C|
    I now am saved.

*2.* Feasting on the husks around me
   Till my strength was almost gone;
   Longed my soul for
    something better,
   Only still to hunger on.

*3.* Poor I was, and
    sought for riches—
   Something that would satisfy;
   But the dust I gathered round me
   Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.

*4.* Well of water—ever springing,
   Bread of life, so rich and free,
   Untold wealth that never faileth,
   My Redeemer is to me.
