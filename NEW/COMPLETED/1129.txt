*1.* Every high mountain
         |7|*/*|11|
   That stands in my way
    |5|*/*|9|
   Serves to remind me
        |9|*m*          |7|
   That my God is great.
    |0|
   And when strong giants
    |7|*/*|11|
   Laugh in my face,
     |5|*/*|9|
   Again I’m reminded that
   |7|*sus4*       |7|
   My God is great.

*Chorus:*
              |0|
   And He’s greater,
           |7|*/*|11|
   So the mountains move;
           |9|*m*
   He is greater,
          |5|       |7|
   So the giants fall.
                |9|*m*
    And there’s no such
                |5|*–*|9|*m*
    Thing as impossible
           |5|
   For my God,
           |7|
   Who’s greater
              |5| *(going to bridge:* |0|*)*
    Than them all.


*2.* Sounds of the battle
   I hear every day;
   In them are whispers
   That my God is great.
   And when it feels like
   My world starts to shake,
   I’ll just remember that
   My God is great.

*3.* What is the mountain
   You’re facing today?
   Look up to Jesus;
   Remember He’s great.
   And not one giant
   Can stand in His way;
   Jesus will help you
   And you can proclaim that...

*Bridge:*
       |7|                 |9|*m*
   We will not fear the giants,
       |7|                 |9|*m*
   We will not fear the mountains,
       |7|                |9|*m*
   We will not fear for God is near,
       |5|
   And He
                         |7|*sus4-*|7|
    is greater than them all.
