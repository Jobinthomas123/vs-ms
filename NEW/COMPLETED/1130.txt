*1.* Fire, fire, fire!

   Set my soul on fire,
            |11|*7*
   Yes, my soul on fire,
              |4|
   With that Holy Ghost fire.

   It burns up carnal natures;
       |8|*m*            |1|*m*
   Hallelujah, what a Savior.
           |9|        |4|
   Set my soul on fire
        |11|*7*          |4|
   With Holy Ghost fire.

*2.* Fire, fire, fire
   When my soul’s on fire
   Yes, my soul’s on fire
   With that Holy Ghost fire
   It burns up carnal natures
   Hallelujah, what a Savior
   When my soul’s on fire
   With Holy Ghost fire
