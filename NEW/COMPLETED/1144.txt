*1.* Walking on the street of gold
        |C|             |D|*/*|F#|
   Our Savior we’ll behold;

   Singing with the spotless saints
        |C|      |D|*/*|F#|       |G|
   Who are His precious fruits.

   Song of Zion fills all the heav’n
         |G|*7*                |C|
   Which no one else can learn;
   |A|*sus*               |A|*7*
   Save the ones who fought on earth
     |C|*maj7/*|D|           |D|*7*
   A fight of immense worth.

*Chorus:*
     |G|        |E|*m9*               |D|*7*
   Clothed in garment that is clean

    and bright;

   Faithful overcomer’s right.
   |G|        |G|*/*|B|    |C|        |D|*/*|F#|
   We shall be His sons of might
    |A|*m*      |D|*7*              |G|*sus––*|G|
   Dwelling in the glorious light.

*2.* Following the Lamb once slain
   Called unto holy Zion;
   Meek and lowly ne’er we fail
   To do the Father’s will.
   Bearing all reproach and shame
   We suffer for His name.
   More than conq’rors by His love
   We seek the things above.

*3.* Passing through the vale of tears
   Although assailed by fears;
   Making it a fount of grace
   We lift our hearts in praise.
   Strengthened by His might, and lo,
   From strength to strength we go;
   Till we all appear in Zion
   With victor’s crown we’ve won.

*4.* Serving Him, the King of kings,
   What joy and thrill it brings!
   Willingly His yoke to bear
   We’ll all His burdens share.
   Strong in faith and vision clear
   Our life we count not dear.
   With the Triune God we will
   Be e’er on Zion’s hill.

*5.* Ent’ring through the riven veil
   Within the holiest pale;
   Dauntless, fearless to the end
   We’ll Satan’s power rend.
   Having fought the fight of faith
   And conquered sin and death;
   Triumphantly we’ll be borne
   To Father’s glorious throne.
