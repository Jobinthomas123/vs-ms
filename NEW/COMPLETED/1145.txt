           |A|*m*
*1.* When I call
                         |D|*m -* |E|*7*
    and no one seems to listen,
           |A|*m*
   When I knock
                       |E|
    and every door is sealed,
            |D|*m7*    |G|*7*
   God will not be silent
            |C|*maj7 ––* |F|*maj7*
    without reason;
              |B|*7*
   They that trust Him
                |E|*7*
    never are ashamed.

*Chorus:*
         |F|     |G|             |C|
   O my soul, wait upon the Lord;
             |D|*m7*
   Cleave to Him
          |G|*7*          |C|*maj7*
    and cleave to Him alone.
            |F|           |E|*m*
   He will come to you, answer you,
     |D|*m7*          |C|*maj7*
   Deliver you in time.
        |D|*m9*    |E|*7*            |A|*m*
   O my soul, wait upon the Lord.

*2.* Wasted tears and wasted years
    of weeping;
   What can bring
    forfeited joys again?
   But I know the Lord
    is slowly working
   Some eternal goodness
    through the pain.

*3.* Though I’m tossed around
    like troubled water;
   Though confused,
    I tell my trembling soul,
   “You must learn to trust
    the Master Potter;
   You must learn to give Him
    full control.”

*4.* When at last the molding work
    is ended,
   Then His love and wisdom
    I shall see.
   Joy and pain through perfect love
    have blended,
   Working out
    the perfect bride in me.
