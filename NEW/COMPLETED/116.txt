             |7|
It’s coming down, down, down,

It’s coming down.

And, the glory of the Lord
            |2|*7*
 is coming down.
          |7|                |7|*7*
When the saints begin to pray,
          |0|
Then the Lord will have
      |9|m7
 His way,
          |7|           |2|*7*
And the glory of the Lord
            |7|
 is coming down.
