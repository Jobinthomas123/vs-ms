I am determined,
      |7|
I’ve made up my mind,
                |0|
I’ll serve the Lord.

I’ll leave this world
          |7|*7*
And its pleasure behind;
                |0|
I’ll serve the Lord.
      |5|                  |0|
I’ll follow wherever He leadeth;
     |2|*7*                   |7|
I’ll pasture wherever He feedeth.
