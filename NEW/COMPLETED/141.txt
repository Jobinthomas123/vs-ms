The Spirit of the Lord
          |4|*m*   *-*|9|
 is now upon me
             |9|*7*
To heal the broken heart
             |2|*dim*      |2|
And set the captives free,
                    *-*|2|*7*
To open prison doors
              |7|        *-*|4|*m*
And make the blind to see.
      |9|   |7|        |2|*-*|9|*7*
The Spirit of the Lord
            |2|
 is now on me.
