*1.* How sweet are the tidings
            |0|
    that greet the pilgrim’s ear
                    |9|*m*
   As he wanders an exile
          |2|*m-*|7|
    from home;
            |0|             |5|
   For he knows that his King
              |0|             |9|*m*
    from the heav’n shall appear
       |0|          |2|*m*
   To gather all those
        |7|    |0|
    who overcome.

*Chorus:*
         |0|
   How great a calling,
           |5|         |2|*m7*
    this great high calling—
        |0|                  |9|*m7*
   Eye hath not seen its treasures;
             |2|*7*                 |7|
   Ear hath not its greatness heard.
         |0|
   What God hath stored

    for pilgrims,
       |5|               |2|*m7*
   No moth nor rust corroding,
         |0|              |5|
   There is a lasting kingdom
          |7|             |0|
    that never shall be marred.

*2.* The grave not the goal
    that blasts the pilgrim’s hope,
   As he labors for sinners to save;
   For he knows that on earth,
    wide the field of his scope,
   As he tells of the One
    Who forgave.

*3.* The world not his gain
    that robs the vision great,
   As he spends and is spent
    for his Lord;
   For he looks not to man
    that his cause vindicate,
   While he works with the saints
    in one accord.

*4.* He seeks not his own,
    be it comfort, selfish gain,
   For the Lord he is seeking
    to please;
   And his thoughts are afar,
    in His kingdom to reign,
   What he sows now the Lord
    will increase.

*5.* Blessed hope of the saint
    anchored now within the veil,
   Gives sweet peace and a rest
    in the storm.
   As the trials perfect now
    there is nought to bewail,
   While he waits for the trumpet
    to inform.
