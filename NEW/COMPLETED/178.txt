        |2|            |9|         |2|
*1.* Just as I am, without one plea,
         |9|        |9|*7*
   But that Thy blood
          |7|       |2|
    was shed for me,
                  |2|*7*
   And that Thou bidd’st me
     |7|       |4|*m7*
    come to Thee,
      |2|             |9|
   O Lamb of God, I come!
    |9|*7* |2|
    I come!

*2.* Just as I am, and waiting not,
   To rid my soul of one dark blot,
   To Thee Whose blood
    can cleanse each spot,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

*3.* Just as I am, tho’ tossed about
   With many a conflict,
    many a doubt,
   Fightings and fears
   Within, without,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

*4.* Just as I am, poor,
    wretched, blind;
   Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
   Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

*5.* Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
   Wilt welcome, pardon,
    cleanse, relieve.
   Because Thy promise I believe,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!
