      |4|   |4|*4*  |4|       |6|*m –* |11|*7*
*1.* I want my life to be
                    |6|*m*         |4|
    all filled with praise to Thee,
                |11|*7*
   My precious Lord divine
            |4|*dim* |4|
    Who died for me.
           |4|*4*  |4|        |6|*m –* |11|*7*
   Let all my will be Thine—
                   |6|*m*    |4|
    controlled by love divine.
               |9|       |4|
   Live out in me Thy life,
       |9|   |4|  |11|*7-*|4|
    O mighty Savior.

*Chorus:*
   |4|                   |11|*7*
   Thy blessed will divine;
                |6|*m*     |4|
    with joy I make it mine.
                            |11|*7*
   My heart shall be Thy throne,
                |4|
    and Thine alone.
               |4|*4*   |4|       |6|*m –* |11|*7*
   Choose Thou the path I tread
                     |4|
    and whither I am led,
               |9|      |4|
   Help me to follow on,
       |9|   |4|  |11|*7-*|4|
    O mighty Savior.

*2.* A pilgrim born anew,
    a stranger passing through,
   Not of this world am I,
    since I am Thine.
   Weaned from its passing show,
    transformed Thy love to know,
   Hold Thou my hand in Thine,
    O mighty Savior.

*3.* When evil foes assail
    and almost would prevail,
   In that dark hour be Thou
    my strength and shield.
   Lend then Thy strong embrace,
    uphold me by Thy grace,
   In weakness be my strength,
    O mighty Savior.

*4.* Yea, choose the path for me,
    although I may not see
   The reason Thou dost will
    to lead me so.
   I know the toilsome way
    will lead to realms of day
   Where I shall dwell with Thee,
    O mighty Savior.
