*1.* Search me, O God,
                 |11|*7*      |4|
    and know my heart today;
    |9|         |4| *–* |1|*m7*
   Try me, O Savior,
      |6|*m7*    |11|          |11|*7*
    know my thoughts, I pray.
    |4|   |9|        |4|
   See if there be some wicked
     |11|*7*     |4|
    way in me;
     |9|             |4|      |9|
   Cleanse me from ev’ry sin,
       |6|*m7*  |11|*7*  |4|
    and set me free.

*2.* I praise Thee, Lord,
    for cleansing me from sin;
   Fulfill Thy Word,
    and make me pure within.
   Fill me with fire, where once I
    burned with shame;
   Grant my desire to magnify
    Thy name.

*3.* Lord, take my life,
    and make it wholly Thine;
   Fill my poor heart
    with Thy great love divine.
   Take all my will, my passion,
    self and pride;
   I now surrender, Lord,
    in me abide.

*4.* O Holy Ghost,
    revival comes from Thee;
   Send a revival —
    start the work in me.
   Thy Word declares Thou wilt
    supply our need;
   For blessing now, O Lord,
    I humbly plead.
