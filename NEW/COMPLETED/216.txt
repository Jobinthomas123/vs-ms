*1.* Come, we that love the Lord,
                         |11|
   And let our joys be known.

*Chorus:*
          |4|
   We’re marching to Zion,
                         |11|*7*
   Beautiful, beautiful Zion.
           |4|
   We’re marching upward
         |9|*-* |6|*m7*
    to Zion,
        |4|         |11|       |4|
   The beautiful city of God.

*2.* Let those refuse to sing
   Who never knew our God;
   But children of the heav’nly King,
   But children of the heav’nly King,
   May speak their joys abroad,
   May speak their joys abroad.

*3.* The hill of Zion yields
   A thousand sacred sweets
   Before we reach
    the heav’nly fields,
   Before we reach
    the heav’nly fields,
   Or walk the golden streets,
   Or walk the golden streets.

*4.* Then let our songs abound
   And ev’ry tear be dry.
   We’re marching thro’
    Emmanuel’s ground,
   We’re marching thro’
    Emmanuel’s ground,
   To fairer worlds on high,
   To fairer worlds on high.
