    in the blood.

*3.* Would you be whiter,
    much whiter than snow?
   There’s power in the blood,
    power in the blood.
   Sin stains are lost
    in its life-giving flow;
   There’s wonderful power
    in the blood.

*4.* Would you do service
    for Jesus your King?
   There’s power in the blood,
    power in the blood.
   Would you live daily
    His praises to sing?
   There’s wonderful power
    in the blood.
