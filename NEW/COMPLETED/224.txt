*1.* What a wonderful change

    in my life has been wrought,
           |0|        |9|*m7*      |7|
   Since Jesus came into my heart.

   I have light in my soul

    for which long I had sought,
          |9|                  |2| *–* |2|*7*
   Since Jesus came into my heart!

*Chorus:*
           |7|
   Since Jesus came into my heart,
          |0|                  |7|
   Since Jesus came into my heart;

   Floods of joy o’er my soul
                          |7| *-*
    like the sea billows roll -
  |0|        |7|             |2|*7*  |7|
   Since Jesus came into my heart.

*2.* I have ceased from my
    wand’ring and going astray,
   Since Jesus came into my heart.
   And my sins which were many
    are all washed away,
   Since Jesus came into my heart!

*3.* I’m possessed of a hope
    that is steadfast and sure,
   Since Jesus came into my heart.
   And no dark clouds of doubt now
    my pathway obscure,
   Since Jesus came into my heart!

*4.* There’s a light in the valley of
    death now for me,
   Since Jesus came into my heart.
   And, the gates of the city
    beyond I can see,
   Since Jesus came into my heart!

*5.* I shall go there to dwell in that city
    I know,
   Since Jesus came into my heart.
   And I’m happy, so happy,
    as onward I go,
   Since Jesus came into my heart!
