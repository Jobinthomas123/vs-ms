           |7|
*1.* I’ve believed the true report—
         |0|            |7|
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!

   I have passed the outer court,
         |9|          |2|
   Oh, glory be to God!
        |7|
   I am all on Jesus’ side—
          |0|            |7|
   On the altar sanctified.

   To the world and sin I’ve died—
         |2|            |7|
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!

*Chorus:*
         |7|      |0|   |7|
   Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
           |2|               |2|*7*
   I have passed the riven veil
               |0|            |7|
   Where the glories never fail.
                |0|    |7|*-*|4|*m*
   Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
         |9|*m*             |2|*7*
   I am living in the presence
            |7|
    of the King.

*2.* I’m a king and priest to God—
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!
   By the cleansing of the blood,
   Oh, glory be to God!
   By the Spirit’s power and light,
   I am living day and night
   In the holiest place so bright—
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!

*3.* I have passed the outer veil—
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!
   Which did once
    God’s light conceal,
   Oh, glory be to God!
   But the blood has brought me in
   To God’s holiness so clean,
   Where there’s death to
    self and sin—
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!

*4.* I’m within the holiest pale—
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!
   I have passed the inner veil,
   Oh, glory be to God!
   I am sanctified to God,
   By the power of the blood.
   Now the Lord is my abode—
   Hallelujah to the Lamb!
