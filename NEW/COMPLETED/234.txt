*1.* I have a song that Jesus

    gave me;
           |2|*7*                |7|
   It was sent from heav’n above.
                 |0|
   There never was
    |2|    |7|     |4|*m*
    a sweeter melody;
           |9|*7*        |2|
   ‘Tis a melody of love.

*Chorus:*
   |2|*7*                |7|
   In my heart there rings

    a melody.
          |2|*7*
   There rings a melody
          |7|
    with heaven’s harmony.
   |2|*7*                 |7|
   In my heart there rings

    a melody;
          |2|*7*                |7|
   There rings a melody of love.

*2.* I love the Christ Who died
    on Calv’ry,
   For He washed my sins away;
   He put within my heart a melody,
   And I know it’s there to stay.

*3.* ’Twill be my endless theme
    in glory;
   With the angels I will sing.
   ’Twill be a song
    with glorious harmony
   When the courts of heaven ring.
