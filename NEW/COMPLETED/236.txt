*1.* How I praise Thee,
      |0|       |7|
    precious Savior,
             |2|                |2|*7*
   That Thy love laid hold of me.
              |7|          |0|
   Thou hast sav’d and cleansed
         |7|
    and filled me,
           |2|          |2|*7*    |7|
   That I might Thy channel be.

*Chorus:*
            |2|              |7|
   Channels only, blessed Master,
            |0|
   But with all
         |9|*m7*      |7|
    Thy wondrous power.
             |2|
   Flowing thro’ us,
               |7|
   Thou canst use us
          |0|       |2|     |7|
   Every day and every hour.

*2.* Just a channel, full of blessing
   To the thirsty hearts around,
   To tell out Thy full salvation,
   All Thy loving message sound.

*3.* Emptied that Thou shouldest
    fill me,
   A clean vessel in Thy hand.
   With no power but as Thou givest
   Graciously with each command.

*4.* Witnessing Thy power to save me,
   Setting free from self and sin.
   Thou hast bought me
    to possess me;
   In Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

*5.* Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit,
   Hearts that full surrender know
   That the streams of Living Water,
   From our inner man may flow.
