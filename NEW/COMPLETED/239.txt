*1.* Oh, welcome all you
                     |9|*m*
    noble saints of old,
       |2|
   As now before
                      |11|*7*
    your very eyes unfold
       |4|*m*
   The wonders of so
                 |9|*m-  —*|9|*m7*
    long ago foretold—

   God and man at table
             |4|*m*
    are sat down.


*2.* Elders, martyrs,
    all are falling down.
   Prophets, patriarchs
    are gath’ring ‘round.
   What angels longed to see,
    now man has found.


   *x2*
   God and man at table
    are sat down.


*3.* Who is this that spreads
    the victory feast?
   Who is this that makes
    our warring cease?
   Jesus, risen Savior,
    Prince of peace—


   *x2*
   God and man at table
    are sat down.


*4.* Worship in the presence
    of the Lord
   With joyful songs
    and hearts of one accord,
   And let our Host
    at table be adored.


   *x2*
   God and man at table
    are sat down.


*5.* When at last the earth
    shall pass away,
   When Jesus and His bride
    are one to stay—
   The feast of love
    has just begun that day.

   *x2*
   God and man at table
    are sat down.
