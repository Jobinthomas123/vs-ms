*2.* Joy to the world!
   The Savior reigns;
   Let men their songs employ.
   While fields and floods,
    rocks, hills and plains
   Repeat the sounding joy,
   Repeat the sounding joy,
   Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

*3.* No more let sins
    and sorrows grow,
   Nor thorns infest the ground.
   He comes to make
    His blessings flow
   Far as the curse is found,
   Far as the curse is found,
   Far as, far as the curse is found.

*4.* He rules the world
    with truth and grace
   And makes the nations prove
   The glories of His righteousness,
   And wonders of His love,
   And wonders of His love,
   And wonders, wonders
    of His love.
