For unto us a Child is born;
     |2|     |0|      |7|
Unto us a Son is given,
         |0|
And the government shall

 be upon His shoulder.
          |2|             |0|
And, His name shall be called:
       |7|           |2|
Wonderful, Counsellor,
            |7|
The Mighty God,
    |0|            |7|
The Everlasting Father,
          |2|        |2|*7*       |7|
And the Prince of Peace is He.
