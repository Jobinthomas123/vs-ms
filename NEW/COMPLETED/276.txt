*1.* O watchful pilgrim,
     |5|         |0|
    lift your voice,
                             |7|*7*
   For joy cometh in the morning;
          |0|
   Break forth in joy
         |5|       |0|
    and publish peace,
                          |7|*7* |0|
   For joy cometh in the morning.

*Chorus:*
   |7|*7*                 |0|
   Joy cometh in the morning!
    |5|                 |0|
   Joy cometh in the morning!
                   |5|          |2|*m7*
   Suff’ring may endure for a night,
        |0|                |7|*7*  |0|
   But joy cometh in the morning!

*2.* Say, “Tempest tossed,
    be comforted”,
   For joy cometh in the morning.
   When least esteemed and buffeted,
   Say, “Joy cometh in the morning!”

*3.* Oh, glorious freedom to His sons
   When joy cometh in the morning.
   From labors they may ever rest,
   For joy cometh in the morning.

*4.* Oh, say, “Rejoice!”
    Thou bride of Christ!
   Thy joy cometh in the morning.
   Adorn thyself with righteousness;
   Thy joy cometh in the morning.

*5.* This Lamb that’s worthy
    once was slain.
   True joy cometh in the morning.
   On throne of God He doth now sit;
   Our joy cometh in the morning.
