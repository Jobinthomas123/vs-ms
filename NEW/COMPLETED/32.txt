Thou hast turned my mourning

  into dancing for me;
                           |4|*7*
Thou hast put off my sackcloth.

Thou hast turned my mourning

  into dancing for me
                     |2|  |9|
And girded me with gladness.

To the end that my glory

  may sing praise to Thee
            |2|
And not be silent;
  |11|*m*        |9|
O Lord, my God, I will give
    |4|                 |2|*-*|9|
  thanks unto Thee forever.
