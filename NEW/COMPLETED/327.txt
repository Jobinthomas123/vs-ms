*1.* Oh, I dearly love to ponder
              |5|             |0|
    when the sun is sinking low,

   And I’m pressing on my journey
                  |2|*7*     |7|
    through this world below—
          |0|
   Of a blessed time that’s coming
            |5|
   When my feet no more
           |0|
    shall roam.
            |2|*7*
   Here the way is often thorny,
             |7|    |2|*7*   |7|*7*
    but the road leads home.

*Chorus:*
           |0|
   It’s a narrow way.
          |5|      |2|*m7*
   It’s a narrow way.
         |5|                  |0|
   It is often rough and thorny,
              |2|*7*         |7|
    but this way leads home.
            |0|
   And, my Savior’s gone

    before me;
          |5|
   He has given His Word
             |0|
    to cheer me;
                        |9|*m7*
   Yes, a narrow way to glory,
             |2|*m7*   |7|    |0|
    but this way leads home.

*2.* When I climb up hills of trial,
    When the tempest wild
    doth sweep,
   And descend affliction’s valley
    with its shadows deep;
   I can hear Him sweetly saying,
    “All this weary path I’ve gone.
   Yes, I know the way is thorny,
    but the road leads home.”

*3.* When my friends forsake
    and leave me,
   In the world I’m left alone,
   What a bliss to know
    He’s with me,
   All to Him I owe;
   And the shame, despising ever,
   I’ll the race with patience run;
   For I’ll look to Him the Author
    till the prize be won.

*4.* So, I’ll bear the cross for Jesus
    for His love constraineth me.
   I will follow in His footsteps
    till His face I see.
   In my Father’s house of mansions,
   I shall never sigh nor moan;
   So I sing along the journey
    for the road leads home.
