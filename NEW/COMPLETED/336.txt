Come let us go up
       |2|*m*              |7|
To the mountain of the Lord—
 |2|*m*     |7|            |0|
To the house of our God.

And, He will teach us
         |0| *—* |9|*m*
 of His ways,
    |5|       |7|            |5|*—*|0|
And we will walk in His paths.
     |5|       |7|          |0|
For, out of Zion shall go forth
      |9|*m*
 the law
         |2|*m*          |7|
And the Word of the Lord
             |0|
 from Jerusalem.
