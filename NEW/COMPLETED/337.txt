Thy lovingkindness

 is greater than the heavens;

Thy lovingkindness
      |11|*m*              |4|*m -*|9|
 is greater than the earth.
          |4|*m*
Thy lovingkindness
                     |9|
Is greater than the sun,
      |4|*m*            |9|
 the moon and the starsâ€”
    |4|*m*       |9|           |2|
Thy mercy to me, O dear Lord!

Thy lovingkindness has been
                |4|*m*
 shown forth in me;
          |6|*m*
Thy lovingkindness,
                  |11|*m*
 it teaches me to live.
          |4|*m*
Thy lovingkindness,
                     |9|
 it leads me in the way
     |4|*m*             |9|
That Christ has prepared
          |2|
 just for me.
