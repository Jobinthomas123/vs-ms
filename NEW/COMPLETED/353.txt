*1.* Do you hear them coming,
      |9|
    brother,
     |2|*/*|9|                 |9|
   Climbing up to Zion’s height
                             |4|  |2|
   Clad in glorious shining garments,
     |4|*7*
   Blood-washed garments
                |9|
    pure and white?

*Chorus:*
           |9|
   ‘Tis a glorious church
        |2|             |9|
    without spot or wrinkle—
                  |6|*m*
   Washed in the blood
             |4|  |4|*7*
    of the Lamb.
           |9|
   ‘Tis a glorious church
        |2|              |9|
    without spot or wrinkle—
                   |6|*m*  |4|       |9|
   Adorned as the bride of the Lamb.

*2.* Do you hear the stirring anthems,
   Filling all the earth and sky?
   ‘Tis a grand, victorious army;
   Lift its banner up on high!

*3.* Never fear the clouds of sorrow;
   Never fear the storms of sin.
   We shall triumph on the morrow;
   Even now our joys begin.

*4.* Wave the banner;
    shout His praises.
   For our victory is nigh!
   We shall join our conqu’ring
    Savior;
   We shall reign with Him on high!
