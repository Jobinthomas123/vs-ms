*1.* I’m not ashamed of the Gospel;
                       |7|
    it’s the power of God.
|4|*m*                         |2|
   Jesus, He died and was buried,
             |0|
   And He’s risen
              |7|  *-*|9|*m7-*|2|
    from the dead.
|7|
   Our sickness healed,
        |0|*/*|7|
   The bondage of sin
                |7|
    has been removed;
|4|*m*                    |7|
   Lamb of God, His blood
                |2|
    brings liberty!

*Chorus:*
|9|*m7*              |11|*m/*|9|
   Now Christ is risen,
     |9|*m7*          |2|
    alive forevermore.
|9|*m7*            |11|*m/*|9|         |9|*m7*
   His tomb is empty ‘cause death
                     |0|
    had no power to hold Him;
   |2|          |7|
   He is the Lord.

*2.* Old life of sin has been buried
    in the waters of Jordan;
   Planted with Him, together
    in the likeness of His death;
   Raised from the grave to walk
    in the newness of His life;
   Old things past,
    behold all things made new.

*3.* The fire of God it came down
    on the day of Pentecost;
   Filled with a pow’r
   That would turn the whole world
    upside down;
   “Go heal the sick, cast out devils,
    even raise up the dead;
   Tell the world, My kingdom
    now has come.”

*4.* We shall be changed in a moment,
   Yes, the twinkle of an eye;
   Sin and death they are
    swallowed by His victory.
   When Jesus comes, we know
    we shall be just like Him—
   Face to face, with Him
    forevermore.
