            |4|
*1.* There’s coming a wonderful,

    wonderful day;
          |9|                    |4|
   It’s glory has never been known.

   When free from our burdens,

    we’re going away
   |9|   |4|             |11|*7*     |4|
   As Jesus returns for His own.

*Chorus:*
         |4|
   When Jesus returns for His own
                               |11|*7*
   And carries us up to His throne;
            |4|
   There’ll be no more sadness

   But all will be gladness,
     |9|   |4|            |11|*7*      |4|
   When Jesus returns for His own.

*2.* Then those who have suffered
    and toiled for His name,
   Tho’ hated, rejected, unknown,
   No longer shall suffer
    the world’s scorn and shame,
   When Jesus returns for His own.

*3.* Triumphant they’ll rise
    with their Lord in the air
   And sit with Him soon
    on His throne.
   While those who once ridiculed,
    weep in despair,
   When Jesus returns for His own.

*4.* No longer we’ll think
    of the trial down here,
   The days when we suffered alone;
   For God’s loving hand
    wipes away ev’ry tear,
   When Jesus returns for His own.

*5.* Then let us be faithful
    e’en down unto death,
   Nor ever our troubles bemoan;
   But render Him praise
    and rejoice full of faith,
   That we may be counted His own.
