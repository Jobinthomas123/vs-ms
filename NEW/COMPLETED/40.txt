   He is high and lifted up
             |7|
   And His train fills the temple.
          |2|*7*
   He is high and lifted up
             |7|
   And His train fills the temple.

   The angels cry, “Holy,”

   The angels cry, “Holy,”

   The angels cry,
         |2|*7*      |7|
   “Holy is the Lord.”

   As His Word issues forth
   It resounds through the temple …

3. love…
   He is high and lifted up
   Yet He dwells with the lowly …
