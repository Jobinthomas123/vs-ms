   |D|
*1.* Open your eyes
           |E|*m7*
    to the world all around you.
   |G|              *–* |D|*/*|F#| *–*
   Open your eyes,
    |A|
    open your eyes.
         |D|
   This world is much more than
          |E|*m7*
    the things that surround you;
    |G|
   You must arise,
        |D|*/*|F#|*-*|A|
    and now open your eyes.
        |G|
   Sometimes we’re too busy
         |D| *—* |A|
    to share,
        |G|                 |A|*4 -* |A|
   But Jesus wants us to care.

*Chorus:*
    |D|                  |A|*/*|C#|
   Jesus says when we touch
                     |B|*m*
    someone in His name,
                   |G|
   We’re touching Him.
    |D|                  |A|*/*|C#|
   Jesus says when we feed
                     |B|*m*
    someone in His name,
                  |G|
   We’re feeding Him.
    |D|                  |A|*/*|C#|
   Jesus says when we love
                     |B|*m*
    someone in His name,
                 |G|
   We’re loving Him.
        |G|
   So, we need to show them
         |D|*/*|F#|
    the light,
       |G|
   And we must pour out
         |A|*4 -* |A|
    our lives.

*2.* Open your arms
    to the naked and shiv’ring.
   Open your arms, open your arms.
   A little less taking,
    a whole lot more giving;
   So safe and warm,
    we can open our arms.
   And, love just a little bit stronger,
   And pray a little bit longer.

*3.* Open your hearts
    to the ones who are desp’rate.
   Open your hearts,
    open your hearts.
   They’ll never repay you,
    but their souls are worth it;
   Life you’ll impart
    when you open your heart.
   And, Jesus loves all men the same,
   We must go out in His name.

*Ending:* (Sung after chorus)
    |D|                  |A|*/*|C#|
   Jesus says when we love
                     |B|m
    someone in His name,
                  |G| *—-* |A|
   We’re loving Him;
                 |D|
   We’re loving Him.
