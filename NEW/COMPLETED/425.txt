*1.* As each day passes by,
        |D|*7*              |G|
    I feel my love run dry;
     |D|*/*|G|     |B|*m7*   |C|*ma7 -* |A|*m7*
   I get so weary-worn
         |D|*7*                    |G|
    and tossed ‘round in the storm.
        |E|*m7*     |B|*m7*      |C|*ma7 -* |A|*m7*
   I’m blind to others’ needs;
         |D|*7*                |G|
    I’m tired of planting seeds.
      |D|*/*|G|     |B|*m7*   |C|*ma7 -* |A|*m*
   I seem to have a wealth of so
     |D|*7*
    many thoughts about myself;

*Chorus:*
|G|            |B|*m*
   I want to, I need to
   |C|              |G|    *-*|D|
    be more like Jesus.
|G|            |B|*m*
   I want to, I need to
   |C|              |D|
    be more like Him,
                 |G|
   Be more like Him.

*2.* Our Father’s will was done
    by giving us His Son,
   Who paid the highest cost
    to point us to the cross,
   And, when I think of Him
    Who took the whole world’s sin,
   I take one look at me compared
    to what I’m called to be.

*3.* The end of all my prayers—
    to care like my Lord cares.
   My one and only goal—
    His image in my soul.
   My weakness is revealed,
    but by His stripes I’m healed;
   He’s faithful and He’s true
    to complete the work He begins
    in you.
