    |D|      |B|*m*     |E|*m*            |A|
*1.* Certainly, I shortly will return.
  |D|              |B|*m*
   This Word is faithful
            |E|*m*         |A|
    and it must be fulfilled,
  |G|              |A|
   And I shall bring with Me
       |F#|*m -* |B|*m*
    reward
 |E|*m*            |A|             |D|
   To give to him who out of love
           |D|*7*
    truly served Me
  |G|           |A|
   And who in every trial
     |F#|*m*              |B|*m*
    has been proven true,
        |E|
   Who lived victoriously,
   |E|*m*                |A|
    whose hope is in Me.

*Chorus:*
    |D|    |F#|
   Come quickly,
     |B|*m*
    come back quickly, Lord!
        |E|*m7*
   I’m longing to see
            |A| *–* |A|*7*
    Your return.
    |D|    |F#|
   Come quickly,
     |B|*m*
    come back quickly, Lord!
          |E|*m7*
   To be caught up
                       |A|
    to Your presence, Lord,
       |A|*7*         |D|
   For all eternity!

*2.* Yes, I know that soon
    You shall return;
   The time is short now,
    yet there’s still much to do!
   O Lord, perfect in me, I pray,
   That work of grace, now,
    that Calvary’s love started.
   Lord, You have promised,
    so I wait expectantly;
   I’m trusting in Your Word,
    it’s faithful and true!
