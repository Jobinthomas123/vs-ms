*Chorus:*
          |A|
   If  we walk in the light
        |D|            |B|*m*
    as He is in the light,
             |A|
   We have  fellowship
    |F#|*m*        |B|*m —-*|E|*7*
    one with another;
              |A|               |A|*7*
   And the blood of Jesus Christ
      |D|             |B|*m*
    cleanses ev’ry sin,
          |A|           |F#|*m*
   If we walk in the light
       |B|*m*     |E|       |A|
    as He is in the light.

            |E|
*1.* Once in darkness  we were bound,
       |D|                    |A|
   But by His blood we’re free;
            |E|
   So that now as sons of God,
       |D|            |E|
   We live in victory.

*2.* It’s the love of Jesus Christ
   That’s shining in our heart;
   So now let that same light shine,
   And life to all impart.
