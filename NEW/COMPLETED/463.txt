              |E|
    from the heavens.
           |A|*—*|E|*/*|G#|  |F#|*m7*
   All the angels  sing,

   Praise the Lord!
              |A|             |E|
    from the heights of creation;

    |E|     |B|
*1.* He commanded them,
              |A|           |E|
    and the heavens were made;
         |B|
   He established them,
              |A|           |E|
    and they won’t pass away.
        |B|
   The sun and moon
              |C#|*m7*             |F#|
   Praise the Lord with their light,
             |B|
   And the stars up above,
               |F#|*m7*
   They keep shinin’
                 |A|*/*|B|*—*|B|
    through the night.

*2.* And, upon the earth,
    let all nature agree—
   From the mountain tops
    to the depths of the sea;
   The wind and rain,
    and the fiery light,
   All the beasts of the field,
   All the birds in their flight.

*3.* All the people
    who inhabit the world,
   From the ruling kings,
    to the boys and the girls,
   The young and old
    join in praise to His name;
   God alone is supreme—
   Let creation proclaim.
