     |D|
*1.* When I saw
                   |A|*7*
    the cleansing fountain
                         |D|
   Open wide for all my sin,
       |D|*7*                 |G|   *—*|E|*m*
   I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing,
     |D|                   |D|*/*|A|
   When He said,  “Wilt thou
     |A|  |D|
    be clean?”

*Chorus:*
   |D|
   I will praise Him!

   I will praise Him!

   Praise the Lamb
                  |A|*7*
    for sinners slain;
     |D|
   Give Him glory, all ye people,
                           |D|*/*|A|
   For His blood can wash away
     |A|     |D|
    each stain.

*2.* Tho’ the way seems straight
    and narrow,
   All I claimed was swept away;
   My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
   At my feet in ashes lay.

*3.* Then God’s fire upon the altar
   Of my heart was set aflame;
   I shall never cease to praise Him,
   Glory, glory to His name!

*4.* Blessed be the name of Jesus!
   I’m so glad He took me in.
   He’s forgiven my transgressions;
   He has cleansed my heart
    from sin.

*5.* Glory, glory to the Father!
   Glory, glory to the Son!
   Glory, glory to the Spirit!
   Glory to the Three-in-One!
