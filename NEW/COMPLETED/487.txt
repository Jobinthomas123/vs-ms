*Chorus:*
              |G|
   Give your mind to share
         |D|
    His wisdom,
              |E|*m*
   Give your heart to share
         |C|
    His love,
              |G|
   Give your hand that you might
    |A|*m7*              |D|*—*|D|*4—*|D|
    lead men to the way,
             |G|
   Give your eyes that they might
     |D|
    see Him,
             |E|*m*
   Give His truth and He will
     |C|
    free them,
               |G|     *—*|A|*m7*
   And as you love Him,
               |D|     |G|
    give your life away.

    |E|*m*          |G|*/*|F|    |F|
*1.* Jesus came into the world
       |C|              *—*|D|
    a living sacrifice,
      |E|*m*                 |A|*m7*
   To spill His love and empty out
         |D|
    His life;
      |E|*m*            |G|*/*|F|
   And so we are His vessels
               |C|               *—*|D|
    with His blessing to bestow.
       |E|*m*
   The more we give
        |A|*m7*           |D|
    the more we overflow.

*2.* If you want to save your life,
    your life you’ll surely lose;
   His cross is something
    we should not refuse.
   If Jesus gave so freely,
    His whole life for you and me,
   Let’s give our lives
    that His love may be seen.
