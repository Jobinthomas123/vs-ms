 |C|      |G|       |A|*m—*|A|*m/*|G|
God is here with us,
    |F|
As certain as the air
       |G|       |C|      *—*|C|*7*
 that we are breathing.
    |F|                      |G|
As certain as the morning sun
   |E|*m*              |A|*7*
 arises day after day,
    |D|*m*
He promises He’ll never
  |G|
 leave us;
                  |C|
He’s with us to stay.
