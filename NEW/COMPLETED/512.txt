        |D|*m*                     |G|*m*
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord;
    |C|
My soul shall be joyful
        |D|*m*
 in my God.
    |D|*m*
For, He hath clothed me with
      |G|*m*
 the garments of salvation;
|A|
He has covered me with
                       |D|*m*
 the robe of righteousness.
