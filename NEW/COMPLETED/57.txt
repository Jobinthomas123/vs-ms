|2|
He paid a debt
            |2|*7*
 He did not owe;
          |7|                |4|*m*
I owed a debt I could not pay.
          |2|          |11|*m*
I needed someone to wash
            |4|*m7-*|9|
  my sins away.
           |2|
And now I sing
              |2|*7*
 a brand new song:
           |7|
“Amazing Grace” –
               |4|*m7*
 the whole day long,
              |2|
‘Cause Jesus paid the debt
      |4|*m7*      |9|*7*    |2|
 that I could never pay.
