        |G|                 |C|*/*|G|
*1.* The more I know about Jesus,
        |A|*m7*         |D|        |G|
   The more that I want to know;
         |C|               |G|
   The closer I grow to Jesus,
         |C|               |D|
   The closer I want to go.
        |E|*m*
   The higher I climb
              |E|*m/*|D|
    with His hand in mine,
         |C|                |G|
   The clearer that I can see;
        |C|      |G|                 |D|
   The more I give of myself to Him,
        |C|      |D|        |G|
   The more He lives in me.

*Chorus:*
         |C|     |G|
   And, I’ve tried
    |D|          |G|
    living without Him;
  |C|           |G|      |D|        |G|
   It really wasn’t living at all.
  |C|         |G|
   That’s why
         |D|       |E|*m*
    I’m singing about Him;
  |A|*4*            |A|
   He heard my cry,
                    |D| *–* |G|*/*|B| *-* |C|
    He answered my call –
                 |G|
   I gave Him my all.

*2.* The more I talk about Jesus,
   The more that I have to say;
   The more of His love that I share,
   The more that He sends my way.
   The harder I try just to satisfy
   The One who died for me,
   The more I give of myself to Him,
   The more He lives in me.
