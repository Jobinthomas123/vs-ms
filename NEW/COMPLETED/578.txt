            |G|
Lift up your countenance,

All ye saints of God;
           |A|*m*
Lift up your countenance,
         |D|          |D|*7*
For the victory is won.
            |G|
Lift up your countenance,

All ye saints of God,
               |A|*m*  |G|
And give the glo——ry
 |A|*m*      |D|*7*  |G|
 to the Holy One.

          |E|*m*
For, the battle has been won

Through the blood of

 God’s own Son,
        |G|
Who has walked

 from death to life;
        |E|*m*
And no more the gates of hell

Will against the church prevail,
          |G|           |D|
For He’s won the victory—
         |A|*m —* |D|*7*
 eternally.
