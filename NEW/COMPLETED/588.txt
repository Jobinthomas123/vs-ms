*Chorus:*
      |D|         *—*|D|*7*    |G|         *—*|E|*m*
   Through it all,  through it all,
         |A|           |E|*m7*     |A|
   I’ve learned to trust in Jesus;
         |D|
   I’ve learned to trust in God.
     |D|          *—*|D|*7*    |G|         *—*|E|*m*
   Through it all,  through it all,
          |A|           |E|*m7*   |A|*4*
   I’ve learned to depend upon
    |A|*7*  |D|
   His Word.

       |D|
*1.* Now I’ve had many tears

    and sorrows,
    |D|*maj7*
   I’ve had questions for tomorrow;
     |A|*m*
   There’ve been times
       |D|*7*                      |G|
    I didn’t know right from wrong.
           |G|*m*
   But, in every situation
             |D|          |B|*7*
   God gave blessed consolation
            |E|*m7*
   That my trials come
       |A|               |D|
    to only make me strong.

*2.* Yes, I have lots of friends to go to
   In all the trials that I go through,
   There’ve been times
    I felt so all alone.
   But in my lonely hours,
    yes, those precious lonely hours,
   Jesus let me know that
    I’m His very own.

*3.* I thank God for the mountains,
   And I thank Him for the valleys;
   I thank Him for the storms
    He brought me through.
   For if I’d never had a problem,
   I wouldn’t know that
    He could solve them;
   I’d never know what
    faith in God could do.
