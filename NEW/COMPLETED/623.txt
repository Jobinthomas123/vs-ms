    |D|                  |B|*m*
*1.* Lift your eyes and you will see
    |G|               |E|*m7*
   Fields are ready to be reaped.
    |A|               |A|*7*
   Millions perish without Me.
     |G|        *—*|E|*m7*
   Who will seek,
                  |A|*4* *-* |A|
    for My lost sheep?

*Chorus:*
    |D|               |B|*m*
   Not the mighty, not the wise,
    |G|            |E|*m7*
   Not the noble in our eyes,
    |A|           |A|*7*
   But the weak and despised
    |G|            *—*|E|*m7*
   Have You called,
              |A|*4* *-* |A|
   My Lord of all.

*2.* My sheep are hungry,
    poor and blind;
   Lay down your life
    and you will find
   Your deepest need I’ll satisfy.
   Will you hearken to My cry?

*3.* My face you’ll see in eternity,
   And your little life shall be to Me
   The song of songs—
    a sweet melody;
   For on Zion’s mount
    you’ll stand with Me.

*Last Chorus:*
    |D|               |B|*m*
   Not the mighty, not the wise,
    |G|            |E|*m7*
   Not the noble in our eyes,
   |A|            |A|*7*
   But the weak and despised
    |G|            *—*|E|*m7*
   Have You called,
       |A|      |D|
   My Lord of all.
    |B|*m*                |D|
   See your calling, brethren!
          |A|         |A|*7*       |D|
   This great high calling, brethren—
     |B|*m*                   |D|
   Blessed are they that do His will,
       |A|                    |A|*7*
   For in their heart’s the way
                 |D|
    to the holy hill!
