*1.* O Holy Spirit, Comforter Divine,
               |A|*m*
   Impart Thy love
        |D|*m*            |G|  *—*|G|*7*
    and all my life refine.
               |C|
   Deep in my heart,
        |C|*7*                |F| *—*|D|*m*
    my soul doth long to be,
               |C|
   Without a spot,
           |G|        |C| *–*|C|*7*
    free from impurity.

*Chorus:*
             |F|   |D|*m*            |C|
   So, Spirit of the Lord, I pray,
              |D|*7*
   Revive my heart,
                |G| *—*|G|*7*
    come in to stay;
             |C| *—*|C|*7*            |F|*–*|D|*m*
   Abide in me,   Thy work to do,
                |C|*-*|G|               |C|
   And fill my soul with riches true.

*2.* O Holy Spirit,
    gentle, guileless Dove,
   From Thee proceed all choicest
    gifts and love.
   Wilt Thou my longing satisfy,
    I pray,
   Fill me with faith
    and cast my fears away?

*3.* O Holy Spirit,
    source of life and might,
   Enliven now my heart,
    restore my sight,
   Uphold my spirit,
    guide me by the way,
   And lead me gently
    till that glorious day.

*4.* O Holy Spirit,
    Lord of glory bright,
   Reflect in me the glorious
    face of Christ;
   Imprint His image deep down
    in my heart.
   Let all unholy thoughts
    from me depart.

*5.* O Holy Spirit,
    by Thee I’ve prevailed
   The wiles of Satan, dark,
    unclean and wild;
   Strengthen me now
    that I may always be
   A victor by the battles
    fought by Thee.
