*1.* My faith has found a resting place,
       |D|               |G|
   Not in device nor creed.
               |G|*7*  |C|      |A|*m*
   I trust the Everliving One;
        |D|                    |G|
   His wounds for me shall plead.

*Chorus:*
   |G|               |D|
   I need no other argument;
       |E|*m*     |C|      |D|*4 —*|D|
   I need no other plea.
   |D|*7*  |G|    |G|*7*         |C|     |A|*m*
   It  is enough that Jesus died
         |D|      |D|*4*   |D|*7*  |G|
   And that He died for me.

*2.* Enough for me that Jesus saves,
   This ends my fear and doubt.
   A sinful soul I come to Him;
   He’ll never cast me out.

*3.* My heart is leaning on the Word,
   The written Word of God—
   Salvation by my Savior’s name,
   Salvation through His blood.

*4.* My great Physician heals the sick;
   The lost He came to save.
   For me His precious blood
    He shed;
   For me His life He gave.
