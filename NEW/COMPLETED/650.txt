God is the Lord
      |G|            |C|
Who shows us the light;
                  |F|
Strong is loveâ€™s cord
    |G|*4*       |G|    |C|
To bind the sacrifice. *x2*

To the horns of the altar
        |F|         |C|
With Christ crucified,
     |F|         |D|*m7*
His beauty for ashes
       |G|        |C|
When there we abide. *x2*
