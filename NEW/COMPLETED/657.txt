*1.* When pangs of death

    seized on my soul,
      |G|      |F|   |G|*7*  |C|
   Unto the Lord I cried.
                        |A|*m*
   Till Jesus came and made

    me whole,
      |D|*m*        |G|*7*    |C|
   I would not be denied.

*Chorus:*
                     |C|*7*
   I would not be denied.
      |F|        |D|*m*    |C|
   I would not be denied.
                        |A|*m*
   Till Jesus came and made

    me whole,
      |D|*m*       |G|*7*    |C|
   I would not be denied.

*2.* As Jacob in the days of old,
   I wrestled with the Lord;
   And instant, with a courage bold,
   I stood upon His word.

*3.* Old Satan said my Lord was gone,
   And would not hear my prayâ€™r,
   But, praise the Lord!
    The work is done,
   And Christ the Lord is here.
