   And all that is within me
                       |G|

   He heals all our diseases.
             |G|            |D|
   From destruction He redeems

    our lives;

    His steadfast love
   And with His tender mercies;
   He satisfies us with good things.
   O bless His holy name!

*3.* You have not punished us, O Lord,
   According to our sins;
   Your mercy is so great to those
   Who fear Your holy name!

*4.* So, let us keep His covenant
   And do His righteous judgements;
   Take heed unto His holy Word,
   And bless His holy name!
