*Chorus:*
   *x2*
     |E|*m*
   Call unto Me,
              |D|
   And I will answer you
                  |C|
   And show you great
        |D|       |E|*m*
   And mighty things! *x2*

   |C|
*1.* Eye has not seen
         |D|
    nor ear has heard
   |C|         |D|                 |E|*m*
   All that I’ve prepared for you;
   |C|
   Eye has not seen
         |D|
    nor ear has heard
   |C|                         |B|*-*|B|*7*
   All that My Spirit shall do!

*2.* Have I not said, will I not do
   All that I have promised you?
   Trust in My Word; I cannot lie—
   See what My power will do!

*3.* Ask for the rain, the latter rain;
   Time has come to gather you.
   I will restore the wasted years,
   All of My glory renew!

*4.* F*or Zion’s sake I will not rest;
   I will never hold My peace.
   Till she is built in righteousness
   Her glory will never cease.
