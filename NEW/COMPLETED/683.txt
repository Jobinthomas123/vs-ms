    |G|       |C|            |G|
*1.* Face to face with Christ
       |A|*m-*|D|*7*
    my Savior,
   |D|                         |G|
   Face to face what will it be?
              |C|
   When with rapture
     |G|   |A|*m*   |C|
    I behold Him,
   |A|*m*      |G|        |D|*7*       |G|
   Jesus Christ who died for me.

*Chorus:*
    |D|*7*                   |G|
   Face to face shall I behold Him,
    |D|     |A|        |A|*7*      |D|*-*|D|*7*
   Far beyond the starry sky;
    |G|      |G|*7*                |C|*-*|A|*m*
   Face to face in all His glory,
           |G|         |D|*7*    |G|
   I shall see Him by and by!

*2.* Only faintly now I see Him,
   With the darkling veil between.
   But a blessed day is coming
   When His glory shall be seen.

*3.* What rejoicing in His presence,
   When are banished grief and pain,
   When the crooked ways
    are straightened
   And the dark things shall be plain.

*4.* Face to face—O blissful moment!
   Face to face—to see and know!
   Face to face with my Redeemer,
   Jesus Christ Who loves me so.
