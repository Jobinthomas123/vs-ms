*1.* O sacred head, now wounded,
    |E|   |A|*m*          |E|*7*
   With grief and shame
             |A|*m*
    weighed down,
         |F|    |D|*m*       |G|  |C|
   Now scornfully surrounded
    |E|     |A|*m*       |E|*7*    |A|*m*
   With thorns Thy only crown.
       |G|         |F|
   How art Thou pale with
     |C|*4* |C|
    anguish,
         |F|     |D|*m*        |A|
   With sore abuse and scorn!
    |D|*7*  |G|         |C|      |D|   |G|
   How does that visage languish
     |C|   |F|         |G|         |C|
   Which once was bright as morn!

*2.* What Thou, my Lord, hast
    suffered
   Was all for sinner’s gain;
   Mine, mine was the transgression,
   But Thine the deadly pain.
   Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
   ‘Tis I deserve Thy place.
   Look on me with Thy favor;
   Entrust me to Thy grace.

*3.* What language shall I borrow
   To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
   For this Thy dying sorrow,
   Thy pity without end?
   O make me Thine forever;
   And should I fainting be,
   Lord, let me never, never
   Outlive my love for Thee!
