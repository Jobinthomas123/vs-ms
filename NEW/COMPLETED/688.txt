*1.* Hear the Lord of harvest
            |C|      |A|*m*
    gently calling,
             |D|*m*      |G|
   “Who will go and work
        |G|*7*    |C|  |C|*/*|F|
    for Me today?
                      |F|
   Who will bring to Me the lost and
     |C|    |A|*m*
    dying?
             |D|*m7*       |G|*7*
   Who will point them to the
            |C|   |C|*7*
    narrow way?”

*Chorus:*
              |F|
   Speak, my Lord
               |D|*m7*
    (speak my Lord);
            |C|            |A|*m*
   Speak to me (speak to me).
              |D|*m7*       |G|
   Speak, and I’ll be quick to
     |G|*7*      |C|
    answer Thee
                   |C|*7*
    (I’ll answer Thee).
              |F|
   Speak, my Lord
                |D|*m7*
    (speak, my Lord);
             |C|           |A|*m*
   Speak to me (speak to me).
             |D|*m7*      |G|
   Speak, and I will answer,
      |G|*7*         |C|  |F|*/*|G|
    “Lord, send me.”

*2.* When the coal of fire
    touched the prophet,
   Making him as pure as pure can
    be,
   When the voice of God said,
    “Who’ll go for us?”
   The he answered, “Here I am,
    send me.”

*3.* Millions now in sin and
    shame are dying;
   Listen to their sad and bitter cry.
   Hasten, brother, hasten to
    the rescue;
   Quickly answer, “Master,
    here am I.”

*4.* Soon the time for reaping
    will be over;
   Soon we’ll gather for the
    harvest-home.
   May the Lord of harvest
    smile upon us;
   May we hear His blessed,
    “Child, well done!”
