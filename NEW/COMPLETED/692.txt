            |D|              |B|*m*
Whatever the problem might be
             |E|*m7*             |A|
God is able to solve it for you;
              |G|              |A|
Jesus gave His life on the tree
                   |D|        |D|*7*
So that He might de-deliver you.
                 |G|
Come and put your faith in
      |E|*m7*
 His blood;
                    |D|
Let Him do what He wants
           |B|*m*
 to do in you.
              |G|
Just open your heart now
    |A|
 to Him,
               |G| |D|
For our God is able.  (End)

     |G|         |A|
Sometimes we think that
 |D|
 we can solve
      |G|      |A|       |D|
Our problems in our way;
    |G|       |A|       |B|*m*
Instead of running unto Him,
       |E|*7*             |A|*4-*|A|*7*
Oh, we turn and run away.
