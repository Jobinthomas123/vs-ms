  |C|             |D|*m7*
Blessed be the name
        |E|*m7—*|F|*/*|G|
 of the Lord;
       |C|*/*|E|           |A|*m7*
He is worthy to be praised
       |D|*m7—*|G|
 and adored
      |G|*m7/*|C|         |C|*7/*|E|
So we lift up holy hands
    |F|*—*|C|*/*|E|*—*|D|*m*
 in one accord,
           |C|
Singing, “Blessed be the name.
 |E|*m7*
Blessed be the name.
 |D|*m7*             |F|*/*|G|*—*|G|      |C|
Blessed be the name of the Lord.”
