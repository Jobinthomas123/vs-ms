*1.* Unbounded grace,
        |A|*m*        |E|*m7*
    it reached to me,
         |F|        |C|*/*|E|       |G|*4—*|G|
   When hope was gone from view;
       |C|     |G|            |A|*m*     |E|*m7*
   In my despair, Christ came to me
       |F|   |C|    |G|    |C|
   As He alone could do.

*2.* Grace was for me the only way
   My guilt could find relief;
   My destiny was changed that day
   I reached out in belief.

*3.* God’s grace does not
    on me depend;
   It’s God Who is my stay.
   His love is offered without end;
   He walks with me each day.

*4.* The universe with joy will sing
   When grace has won the day,
   As all creation joins to sing;
   “Praise God Who paid
    man’s way!”
