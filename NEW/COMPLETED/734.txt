  Come and fill our homes

   with Your presence;

  You alone are worthy
                |D|
   of our reverence.

  As for me and my house,

   we will serve the Lord.

  Lord, we vow to live holy—
                          |D|
  Bowing our knees to You only.
  |C|*ma7*        |D|
  Staying together,
 |B|*m7*          |E|*m7*
   praying together,
        |C|           |G|
  Any storm we can weather
    |A|*m*                |D|
   trusting in God’s Word.
      |C|*ma7*      |D|
  We need each other—
   |B|*m7*          |E|*m7*
   fathers and mothers,
   |C|            |G|
  Sisters and brothers,
       |A|*m*          |D|
   in harmony and love.
