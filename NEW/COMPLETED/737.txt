*1.* The Lord has given

    a land of good things;

   I will press in
                   |B|*7*
    and make them mine.
                  |E|
   I’ll know His power,

    I’ll know His glory,
               |B|*7*              |E|
   And in His kingdom I will shine.

*Chorus:*
    |E|
   With the high praises
                   |E|*7*
    of God in our mouth
           |A|         |F#|*m*
   And a two-edged sword
             |E|
    in our hand,

   We’ll march right on
              |C#|*m*
    to the victory side,
    |F#|*m*        |B|  |B|*7*    |E|
   Right into Canaan’s land.

*2.* Gird up your armor,
    ye sons of Zion.
   Gird up your armor;
    let’s go to war.
   We’ll win the battle
    with great rejoicing,
   And so we’ll praise Him
    more and more.

*3.* We’ll bind their kings
    in chains and fetters;
   We’ll bind their nobles
    tight in iron
   To execute
    God’s written judgement.
   March on to glory, sons of Zion!
