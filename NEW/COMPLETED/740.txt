      |C|               |A|*m7*
*1.* I hear the Savior say,
            |G|                 |C|
    “Thy strength indeed is small!
             |C|
   Child of weakness,
               |A|*m*
    watch and pray,
           |D|*m7*      |G|       |C|
   Find in Me thine all in all.”

*Chorus:*
   |C|             |F|
   Jesus paid it all,
    |C|      |A|*m7*   |D|*m7—*|G|
    all to Him I owe;
   |C|                |A|*m7*     |F|
   Sin has left a crimson stain—
       |C|          |G|        |C|
   He washed it white as snow.

*2.* For nothing good have I whereby
    Thy grace to claim;
   I will wash my garments white in
    the blood of Calvary’s Lamb.

*3.* And when before the throne I
    stand in Him complete,
   “Jesus died my soul to save,”
    my lips shall still repeat.
