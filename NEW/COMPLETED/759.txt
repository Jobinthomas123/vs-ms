*1.* My child,
        |A|*m*           |D|*m*
    My eyes are ever on you;
         |G|          |G|*7*
   When you’re distressed
                  |C|
    you know I’m near.
                   *—*|C|*7*
   Why do you fret?
               |F|
    Why do you fear?
        |D|                   |G|
   My grace will see you through.

*Chorus:*
   |C| |G|  |F|                   |C|
   I am near as I am that I am;
|A|*m*      |D|*m*          |G|
   I am near, each moment
             |C|  *—*|C|*7*
    by your side.
     |C|   |G|  |F|
   Trust in Me
                        |C|
    and in My presence hide;
|A|*m*         |D|*m*
   Rest in Me,
       |F|*/*|G| |G|      |C|
    for—ev—er be Mine.

*2.* When you’re despised
    and feel forsaken,
   Rejoice! A crown awaits on high.
   Lift up your eyes;
    redemption’s nigh.
   Behold, you are My bride.

*3.* Your prayers, it seems,
    I do not answer;
   Have faith! In Me there’s no
    defeat.
   What I began I will complete;
   My glory you will see.

*4.* In your affliction I’m afflicted;
   Your pain and sorrow I do share.
   As I the cross did gladly bear,
   Oh, follow in my steps!

*5.* Rise up, array yourself with glory;
   My pow’r confess,
    My word proclaim.
   In joy or pain, honor My name—
   My promise shall not fail!
