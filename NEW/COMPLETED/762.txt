   More than friend or life to me;

*2.* Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
   Nor for fame my pray’r shall be;
   Gladly will I toil and suffer,
   Only let me walk with Thee.
   Close to Thee, close to Thee,
   Close to Thee, close to Thee—
   Gladly will I toil and suffer,
   Only let me walk with Thee.

*3.* Lead me thru the vale of shadows;
   Bear me o’er life’s fitful sea.
   Then the gate of life eternal
   May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
   Close to Thee, close to Thee,
   Close to Thee, close to Thee—
   Then the gate of life eternal
   May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
