    |D|                       |F#|*m*
*1.* Lift up your eyes to the fields.
    |G|           |A|*4 -* |A|
   Can you now see?
        |D|                   |F#|*m*
   The harvest so ready to yield,
       |G|               |A|*4 -* |A|
   But who will go for Me?

*Chorus:*
             |G|     |A|
   Will you follow Me?
             |G|     |D|
   Will you follow Me?
   |A|           |B|*m*        |F#|*m*
   Will you forsake your all,
        |G|            |A|
    and answer My call?
             |G|      |A|
   Will you let Me be
                 |G|         |D|
    your joy for all eternity?
            |B|*m*             |E|*m*
   Oh, My child, will you come
        |A|      |D|
    and follow Me?

*2.* Lost souls are dying today;
   Can you hear their cry?
   Will you now show them My way,
   Or will you let them die?

*3.* The joys of this earth pass away,
   But those who do My will
   Will stand with Me in that day
   On that blessed, holy hill.

*4.* I’m calling you now, My child;
   Come and follow Me.
   I’ll be right by your side
   Till the day My face you’ll see!
