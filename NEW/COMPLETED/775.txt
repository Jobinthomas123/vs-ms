*Chorus:*
   *x2*
   |D|               |B|*m*
   Give ear to my words, O Lord,
            |E|*m*              |A|
    and consider my meditation. *x2*

    |F#|                        |B|*m*
   Hearken to the voice of my cry,

    my God,
             |E|*m*        |A|*4 -* |A|
   For unto You will I pray.
   |F#|                             |B|*m*
   And in the morning you shall hear

    my voice;
           |E|*m*                  |A|*4 -* |A|
   I will direct my prayer to You
                 |D|
   And will look up.

    |D|                        |D|*4-*|D|
*1.* Whom have I in heaven but You?

   And upon this earth there’s
     |B|*m*           |E|*m*          |A|
    nothing I desire besides You.
       |G|                 |A|
   My flesh and my heart fail,
        |F#|*m*         |B|*m*
    but God is my strength,
     |E|              |E|*/*|G#|
   Therefore I will lift
               |A|*–*|A|*7*
    my eyes to You.

*2.* It is good to draw  near  unto God.
   And because He is faithful,
    in His name I place my trust.
   For He has been my fortress,
   My help in time of need;
   With great hope
    I wait for Him to come.
