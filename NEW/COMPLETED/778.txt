*1.* As in the day of Pentecost,
                            |B|*7*
   We need Your fire in our souls!
          |E|       |E|*7*
   Great God, we pray
            |A|    |F#|*m*
    quicken us today.
         |E|       |B|*7*     |E|
   Holy Spirit, take control!

*Chorus:*
    |E|       |A|         |E|
   Lord, we need Your fire.
                    |C#|*m*
   How we need Your fire
       |F#|*m*  |B|*7*
    in our souls!
             |E|    |E|*7*        |A|     |F#|*m*
   Let Your fire burn, holy fire burn,
           |E|        |B|*7*
   For we need Your fire
            |E|
    in our souls!

*2.* And in the midst of every trial,
   We need Your fire in our souls!
   Overcoming power,
    every day and hour,
   To defeat our every foe!

*3.* And till You come in glory,
   We need Your fire in our souls!
   When that trumpet sounds
    weâ€™ll be glory bound.
   Oh, what joy, as never known!
