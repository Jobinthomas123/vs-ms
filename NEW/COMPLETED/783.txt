*Chorus:*
     |D|            |D|*7*
   Come fellowship
                  |G|     |E|*m*
    with Me in My sufferings;
        |A|*4*           |A|*7*
   Come drink with Me
                |G|   |A|        |D|
    the cup of ridicule and shame.
                    |D|*7*
   Come walk with Me
                 |G|    |E|*m*
    the road to Calvary.
               |D|          |B|*m*
   Don’t be afraid My child;
     |E|*m*   |A|         |D|  |D|*4*
    love paves the way.

          |D|
*1.* I have led you beside
               |E|*m*    |A|
    the still waters.
  |E|*m*
   I have led you where
     |A|  |A|*7* |D| |D|*4*
    green pastures grow,
           |D|        |D|*7*
   But I’m calling you now
                 |G|   |E|*m*
    to something deeper,
          |D|           |A|*7*
   So the depths of My love
              |D|
    you may know.

*2.* You have tasted the glories
    of heaven.
   You have leaped over walls
    run through troops;
   But I’m calling you now
    to something higher,
   If the heights of My love
    you will prove.

*3.* We have met, lingered long
    in sweet communion.
   We have shared all our joys
    and our pains;
   But My love for you, child,
    it passes knowledge.
   If you’re willing, this love
    you can gain.

*4.* Can you not hear My voice
    gently calling.
   For My love, yes,
    My dove undefiled?
   Don’t delay, come away
    with me, beloved.
   If you follow Me now,
    you’ll be My bride.
