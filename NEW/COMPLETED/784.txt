    |A|*m*    |D|*m*       |E|*m*    |A|*m*
*1.* Love flows from Calvary,
            |C|       |A|*m*     |D|*m*
   Reaching out to you and me.
      |G|
   A ransomed price
        |A|*m*
    to save our lives,
    |F|        |G|        |A|*m*
   Hear Him calling today.

*Chorus:*
       |A|*m*          |G|   |A|*m*
   At Calvary, at Calvary,
    |G|                         |A|*m*
   Sin and death defeated for me!
                  |G|    |A|*m*
   At Calvary, at Calvary,
      |G|      |E|*-*|E|*7*
   My Jesus died,
                      |A|*m*
    that I might be free!

*2.* Healing flows from Calvary,
   From sickness setting all men free.
   Body and soul,
   Our Jesus makes whole;
   If we will but trust in His Word.

*3.* Vict’ry flows from Calvary,
   Conquering every enemy.
   There’s power in His name;
   We’ll not be ashamed.
   By His Spirit we’ll overcome.
