Set my spirit free
              |2|        |0|
That I might worship Thee.

Set my spirit free
               |0|         |7|
That I might praise Thy name.

Let all bondage go
           |2|         |0|
And let deliverance flow;
 |9|*m7*           |2|
Set my spirit free
             |7|
 to worship Thee.
