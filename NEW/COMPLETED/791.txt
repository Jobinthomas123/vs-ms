      |C|                |F|       |D|*m*
*1.* A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
        |C|      |D|       |G|
   That one so weak as I
           |C|          |F|           |D|*m*
   Should ever have a friend like this
       |C|      |G|*7*      |C|
   To lead me to the sky.

*Chorus:*
   |F|      |D|*m*       |C|
   Friendship with Jesus,
   |F|      |C|   |D|*7-*|G|   |G|*7*
   Fellowship divine;
   |C|         |C|*7*
   Oh, what blessed
              |F|  |D|*m*
    sweet communion—
   |C|     |D|*7*      |G|   |G|*7*  |C|
   Jesus is a friend of mine.

*2.* A friend when other
    friendships cease,
   A friend when others fail,
   A friend who gives me
    joy and peace,
   A friend who will prevail.

*3.* A friend to lead me in the dark,
   A friend who knows the way,
   A friend to steer my
    weak, frail bark,
   A friend my debts to pay.

*4.* A friend when sickness
    lays me low,
   A friend when death draws near,
   A friend as through the vale I go,
   A friend to help and cheer.

*5.* A friend when life’s rough
    voyage is o’er,
   A friend when death is past,
   A friend to greet on
    heaven’s shore,
   A friend when home at last.
