*1.* O loving God of peace and grace,
     |B|*m*   |E|*9*               |A|  |A|*7*
   Reveal Thy life through me,
   |F#|  |B|*m*    |B|*m/*|A|  |G|    |G|*m*
   By sanctifying every part
        |G|       |A|*7*   |D|  *-* |D|*7*
   That I might holy be.

*Chorus:*
      |G|       |A|*7*            |F#|*m*  |B|*m*
   O let the beauty of Thy holiness
         |G|        |A|      |B|*m*
   Dear Lord, be seen in me;
       |A|   |F#|     |B|*m*        |E|*7*
   Thy purity, humility and grace
                     |A|*7*
    flow out through me.
        |G|         |A|*7*
   Thy meekness, peace
       |F#|*m*      |B|*m*
    and joy and love,
     |G|      |A|     |F#|     |B|*m*
   O Holy Spirit, gentle Dove,
      |G|         |A|       |D|     |D|*7*
   Descend, restore, renew, refine,
     |G|             |A|     |G|  |D|
   Create in me a life divine.

*2.* Sanctify my spirit, Lord,
   To seek only for Thee.
   Make me to understand Thy ways,
   Obey Thee willingly.

*3.* Sanctify my soul, I pray,
   Affections and desires;
   Help me to choose
    what Thou hast planned,
   And to that end aspire.

*4.* Sanctify my being, Lord,
   To serve Thee faithfully,
   Giving each member
    to be made
   Available to Thee.

*5.* Make me a holy vessel, Lord,
   Just set apart for Thee.
   Lord, purify my every thought,
   Each word and every deed.

*6.* A vision of Thy holiness,
   Lord, give that I might see
   How holy, harmless, undefiled,
   Thy loving bride should be.

*7.* Partaking of Thy holiness,
   I look for that blest day
   When Thou wilt come
    to take me as
   Thy spotless bride away.
