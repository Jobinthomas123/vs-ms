         |E|
*1.* The saints are going home;
       |A|                 |E|
   His coming’s drawing near.
                 |C#|*m*
   He’s building Zion,
              |F#|*m*          |B|
    then in glory He’ll appear.
    |A|            |B|
   Lift up your heads, look up,
          |E|                  |C#|*m*
    the clouds are gathering now;
        |F#|                        |B|
   It’s time for the trumpet to sound.

*Chorus:*
                 |A|   |B|
   It’s time to go;
                 |E|   |C#|*m*
   Lift up your heads.
            |F#|
   Set your face as a flint
              |B|
   Toward the New Jerusalem.
                |E|
   He’s at the door,
               |A|    |F#|*m*
   And when He opens—
         |C#|*m*           |F#|*m*
   In a moment, in a twinkling,
   |B|        |E|
   We’ll be gone.

*2.* His cherished jewels
   He’s gathering
    to their home above;
   How precious in His sight—
    the death of those He loves,
   Who lived their lives down here
    just yearning for that day
   When Jesus, their Savior,
    would come.

*3.* The happenings all
    around assure us that it’s time
   For Christ to come and call away
    His spotless bride;
   All those who have this hope
    will purify their lives
   And wait for the trumpet to sound.

*4.* Let’s labor for the Lord
    with faces lifted high;
   We’re waiting for the day
    we’ll meet Him in the sky.
   The saints who’ve gone before
    are waiting for us, too—
   What joy when the trumpet
    will sound!
