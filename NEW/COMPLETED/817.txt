*2.* More about Jesus, let me learn,
   More of His holy will discern;
   Spirit of God, my Teacher be,
   Showing the things of Christ to
    me.

*3.* More about Jesus in His Word,
   Holding communion with my
    Lord,
   Hearing His voice in every line,
   Making each faithful saying mine.

*4.* More about Jesus on His throne,
   Riches in glory, all His own,
   More of His kingdomâ€™s
    sure increase,
   More of His coming,
    Prince of Peace.
