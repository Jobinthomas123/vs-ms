*1.* Jesus Christ healed the sick
         |D|
    and raised the dead;

   He went about
                  |C|       |G|
    healing all those oppressed.
                |G|*7*
   Everyone who came to Him
     |C|        |A|*m*
    was set free,
   |D|        |D|*/*|F#|              |G|*—*|C|*-*|D|
   And it’s true for you and me!

*Chorus:*
    |G|
   Hosanna!
                 |A|*m*
    Let’s give praise to God!
    |D|                     |C|    |G|
   Hosanna! Christ came from above,
           |G|*/*|B|    |C|      |A|*m*
   Bearing all upon the cross for us—
    |G|*-*|D|*-*|G|
   Hosanna!

*2.* Jesus Christ was wounded for our
    transgressions
   And bruised for all of
    our iniquities.
   Punishment of our peace was on
    Him;
   By His stripes we’ve all been
    healed.

*3.* Sun of righteousness with healing
    in His wings,
   He shall arise for all who
    now fear Him.
   Speedily He will bring
    health and cure;
   Peace and truth shall be restored.

*4.* Healing virtue flowing from
    Mt. Calvary,
   The Balm of Gilead,
    the children’s bread,
   Never changing
    Yahweh Ropheca—
   “I’m the God that healeth thee”

*5.* In a moment, in the twinkling
    of an eye,
   We shall be changed
    and rise up in the sky—
   Bodies all glorious, no more pain,
   When our Jesus comes again!
