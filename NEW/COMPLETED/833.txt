   |E|
*1.* If thou wouldst have
              |A|           |E|
    the dear Savior from heaven
                 |C#|*m*
   Walk by thy side
             |F#|*m*  |F#|        |B|*7*
    from the morn till the even,
    |E|         |E|*/*|G#|            |A|
   There is a rule that each day
               |E|
    thou must follow—
             |C#|*m*     |F#|*m*  |B|     |E|
   Humble thyself to walk with God.

*Chorus:*
    |E|
   Humble thyself and the Lord
               |B|
    will draw near thee;
    |E|                      |C#|*m*
   Humble thyself and His presence
          |F#|*m*    |B|
    will cheer thee.
    |E|          |E|*7/*|G#|
   He will not walk with the
     |A|              |E|
    proud nor the scornful—
    |E|        |C#|*m*     |F#|*m*  |B|     |E|
   Humble thyself to walk with God.

*2.* Just as the Lord in the world’s
    early ages
   Walked and communed
    with the prophets and sages,
   He will come now if thou’ll meet
    the conditions—
   Humble thyself to walk with God.

*3.* Just as the stream finds a
    bed that is lowly,
   Jesus will walk with the
    pure and the holy;
   Cast out thy pride,
    and in heart-felt contrition
   Humble thyself to walk with God.
