*Chorus:*
   |G|      |C|      |D|           |G|
   Going onward, pressing forward
   |C|          |G|         |C|*-*|D|*-*|G|
   On God’s highway of holiness.
             |C|
   Reaching higher,
    |D|            |G|
    my vision brighter,
   |C|         |G|      |C|  |D|     |G|
   As I’m following in His steps.

   |D|             |D|*7*
*1.* To win the prize
               |G|         |C|   |G|
    of this great high calling—
   |D|            |D|*7*
   My goal, my aim
             |C|         |D|
    to be found in Christ.

*2.* What things were gain
    I will count as loss now—
   Forsaking all,
    taking up the cross.

*3.* With banner raised,
    lifting high the standard—
   His truth proclaim,
    glorious victory.

*4.* A race to run,
    filled with grace and glory—
   At journey’s end
    I shall see His face.
