   They hated him;

   They tore his coat
          |F|       |G|       |C|
    and threw him into a pit.

   They sold him for a sum of money
        |F|                      |C|
   And lied to their dad about it.
                   |E|*m*
   But when these brothers
            |A|*m*
   came to Joseph—
          |E|                   |F|
   That heartless, loveless band—
                |G|
   He wept and kissed and
        |E|*m*       |A|*m*
    and fed them all
         |D|*m*           |G|         |C|
   And gave them the very best land.


   A heart like Joseph
              |D|*m* *-* |G|
    we ask, O Lord,
                 |D|*m*   |G|
   That we may serve You
              |C|     |G|
    with one accord,
                     |C|
   That Your great love

   Might spread across the world
       |C|*7*        |F|
   And to our enemies—
                |G|        |E|*m -* |A|*m*
   A love that will not waver
        |D|*m*    |G|  |C|
   And will not cease,
      |F|          |G|       |E|*m -* |A|*m*
   A love that will not waver
        |D|*m*    |G|  |C|
   And will not cease.
