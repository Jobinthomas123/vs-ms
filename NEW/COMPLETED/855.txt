    |A|       |B|*m*
*1.* Lord, I come before Your
       |E|        |A|
    throne of grace;
           |D|            |A|
   I find rest in Your presence
       |B|*m*          |E|
   And fullness of joy.
       |A|           |B|*m*
   In worship and wonder
         |E|         |F#|*m*
    I behold Your face,

   Singing,
     |B|*m*               |E|      |A|
    “What a faithful God have I!”

*Chorus:*
                    |B|*m*
   What a faithful God have I;
 |E|                  |A|  |F#|*m*
   What a faithful God.
                   |B|*m*
   What a faithful God have I—
    |E|                 |A|
   Faithful in every way!

*2.* Lord of mercy, You have
    heard my cry;
   Through the storm
    You’re the Beacon—
   My Song in the night.
   In the shelter of Your wings
    hear my heart’s reply,
   Singing,
    “What a faithful God have I!”

*3.* Lord all sovereign, granting
    peace from heav’n;
   Let me comfort those who suffer
   With the comfort You have giv’n.
   I will tell of Your great love
    for as long as I live,
   Singing,
    “What a faithful God have I!”
