    |C|              |F|
*1.* Trusting in the Lord,
           |G|         |C|
   I will never be ashamed;
           |F|              |C|
   As I’m leaning on His arms,
       |D|*m*            |G|
   How could I ever fall?
          |E|*4*
   For I know that His Word—
           |E|
   Every promise
                |A|*m-*|G|*/*|B|*-*|C|
    He gave to me—
          |F|         |C|*/*|E|
   Is as sure, even more,
             |D|*m*     |G|*4-*|G|
   Than the air I breathe.

*Chorus:*
            |C|           |G|
   I will trust, ever trust.
           |A|*m*
   Holding to the One
         |F|              |G|*4 -* |G|
   Who holds me, I will trust.
            |D|*m*
   When the way
                    |C|*/*|E|
    grows dark and stormy,
            |F|
   Should I doubt
                 |C|*/*|E|
    His goodness toward me,
           |D|*m*            |G|
   For I know my God is for me:
            |F| *-* |C|
    I will trust.

*2.* Listening for His voice,
   I can hear my Savior say,
   “It’s by faith and not by sight
   I call you now to walk.”
   And I know that this path
   He has chosen just for me
   Leads me home where He is
   For eternity.
