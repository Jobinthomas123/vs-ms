*1.* Be still, my soul;
        |A|               |D|
   the Lord is on thy side.
               |E|*m*
   Bear patiently
         |A|               |D|
   the cross of grief or pain.
                 |B|*m*
   Leave to thy God
      |F#|*m*         |E|*m*
   to order and provide;
              |D|*/*|F#|
   In every change,
          |G|     |A|      |F#|*sus-*|F#|
   He faithful will remain.
                  |B|*m*
   Be still, my soul;
        |F#|*m*                 |E|*m*
   thy best, thy heavenly Friend
                   |D|
   Through thorny ways
          |G|    |A|     |D|
   leads to a joyful end.

*2.* Be still, my soul;
    thy God doth undertake
   To guide the future,
    as He has the past.
   Thy hope, thy confidence
    let nothing shake;
   All now mysterious
    shall be bright at last.
   Be still, my soul;
    the waves and winds still know
   His voice Who ruled
    them while He dwelt below.

*3.* Be still, my soul;
    when dearest friends depart,
   And all is darkened
    in the vale of tears,
   Then shalt thou better
    know His love, His heart,
   Who comes to soothe
    thy sorrow and thy fears.
   Be still, my soul;
    thy Jesus can repay
   From His own fullness
    all He takes away.

*4.* Be still, my soul;
    the hour is hastening on
   When we shall be
    forever with the Lord,
   When disappointment,
    grief and fear are gone,
   Sorrow forgot,
    loveâ€™s purest joys restored.
   Be still, my soul;
   When change and tears are past,
   All safe and blessed
    we shall meet at last.
