*Chorus:*
            |G|
   In Your power,
                          |A|*m7*
   I will run and not be weary.
                         |C| *-*|D|*7*
   I will walk and not faint;
                |G|   *-*|C|*/*|D|
   I’ll wait on You.
                  |G|
   Lord, in Your power,
                          |A|*m7*
   I will run and not be weary.
                         |C| *-*|D|*7*
   I will walk and not faint;
                 |G|
   I’ll trust in You.

   |C|            |D|
*1.* You help me mount up
         |C|        |G|
    with eagle’s wings,
       |C|              |D|
   And You strengthen me
          |B|*7*        |E|*m*
    as I wait patiently.
        |C|        |D|
   New hope I receive,
             |B|*m*       |E|*m*
    as Your Word I believe.
         |C|          |G|
   This race I’ve begun,
           |A|*m7*          |D|  *-*|D|*7*
    to the end help me run.

*2.* With Your eyes on me,
    You light my way.
   With my hand in Yours,
    I know my step is sure.
   If my way’s unclear,
    still Your presence is near;
   And You’ll help me stay
    to the end in Your way.

*3.* In the high places
    You help me ride;
   I’m lifted above
    by Your powerful love.
   Yes, I’ll soar beyond
    every fear and all wrong,
   And then on that day,
    You will catch me away.
