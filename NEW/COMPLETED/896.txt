*1.* Wonderful, merciful Savior,
    |C|         |F|           |G|
   Precious Redeemer and Friend,
   |A|*m*               |A|*m/*|G|
   Who would have thought
            |F|
    that a Lamb could
    |C|*/*|G|        |G|        |A|*m*
   Rescue the souls of men?
   |F|        |C|*/*|G|        |G|        |C|
   Oh, You rescue the souls of men.

*Chorus:*
   |A|*m*          |A|*m/*|G|         |F|   |G|
   You are the One that we praise;
   |A|*m*          |A|*m/*|G|    |F|  |G|
   You are the One we adore.
   |A|*m*           |A|*m/*|G|          |F|
   You give the healing and grace our
   |C|*/*|G|            |G|      |A|*m*
   Hearts always hunger for.
   |F|       |C|*/*|G|            |G|      |C|
   Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

*2.* Counselor, Comforter, Keeper,
   Spirit we long to embrace,
   You offer hope
    when our hearts have
   Hopelessly lost the way,
   Oh, we hopelessly lost the way.

*3.* Almighty, infinite Father,
   Faithfully loving Your own,
   Here in our weakness
    You find us
   Falling before Your  throne.
   Oh, weâ€™re falling
    before Your throne.
