   He lives, He lives,

    Who once was dead;

   He lives, my everlasting Head.

*2.* He lives, triumphant
    from the grave.
   He lives eternally to save.
   He lives, exalted, throned above;
   He lives to rule His church in love.

*3.* He lives to silence all my fears.
   He lives to wipe away my tears.
   He lives to calm
    my troubled heart;
   He lives, all blessings to impart.

*4.* He lives—my kind,
    wise heav’nly Friend.
   He lives and loves me to the end.
   He lives, and while He lives,
    I’ll sing;
   He lives, my Prophet,
    Priest, and King!

*5.* He lives, and grants
    me daily breath;
   He lives, and I shall
    conquer death.
   He lives, my future to prepare;
   He lives to bring me safely there.
