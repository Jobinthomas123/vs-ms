        |D|*maj7* |A|*/*|C#|
I never knew every time
  |G|         |A|       |B|*m*
I heard the thunder roar,
      |G|
Your voice was there
   |E|*m*
 reminding me,
     |A|
You love me;
            |D|*maj7*
And I never knew that when
        |G|
 the lightning flashed,
   |B|*m*                |D|*/*|A|
The promise of Your presence
     |G|
Was telling me,
 |E|*m*                |A|
“I will always be with you.”

      |G|              |A|
I can feel it in the rain;
      |F#|*m*            |B|*m*
I can hear it in the wind.
      |G|                  |A|
I can see that it’s Your hand
               |G|             |A|
That guides me to the other side.
         |G|                  |A|
Lord, I know You’re always there,
      |F#|*m*               |B|*m*
And I feel Your endless love
    |G|
Surrounding me
   |A|        |A|*7*     |D|
As I reach out to You.
