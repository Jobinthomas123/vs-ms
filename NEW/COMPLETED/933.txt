*Chorus:*
               |D|*m*
   There is a Rock that is

    higher than I—
            |G|*m*               |A|*4* |A|*7*
   A mighty Rock that I can run to.
         |G|*m*
   If I abide there,
            |D|*m*
    I will never be moved;
                |A|*7*
   His name is Jesus,
                 |D|*m*
    my firm Foundation.

             |G|*m*
*1.* When the children of Israel
     |D|*m*
    wandered
          |A|             |D|*m*
   In a desert land so dry,
        |G|*m*
   The Smitten Rock
      |D|*m*
   He gave them to drink—
            |A|
   Jehovah Cela—
                  |G|*m*
   That Rock was Christ.

*2.* When the ground all around me
    is shaking,
   And I fear my feet may fall,
   I’ll cling to Him Who’s
    steadfast and true.
   The Rock of Ages,
    my Strength, my All.

*3.* When the enemy rages against me
   With his lies and evil plans,
   I listen to the voice of my Lord;
   He keeps me safely
    within His hands.

*4.* Oh, the Lord is
    my Strong Habitation.
   He’s the Shelter from the storm;
   My great High Tower,
    in Him I’ll abide,
   The One Who hides me,
    safe and secure.

*5.* In the arms of the One Who
    does hold me,
   Wondrous peace and joy is mine.
   Until He comes,
    I’m kept in His love;
   I’ll go with Him,
    oh, rapture divine!
