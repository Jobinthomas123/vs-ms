*Chorus:*
            |C|         |E|*m*
   I will stay, every day
           |D|*m7*         |F|*/*|G|
   In the palm of Your hand,
          |D|*m7*
   Held securely
         |F|       |F|*/*|G|      |C|
    by love’s strongest cords.
                                |A|*m*
   No need to fear, for You are here,
           |D|*m7*         |G|
   And You promised to be
                      |G|*7*    |C|
   All I want, all I need today,
              |F|            |G|
   So I will stay in the palm
             |C|
    of Your hand.

       |G|               |F|      |C|
*1.* My life began the day You came;
          |F|
   And I knew that I would
     |F|*/*|G|          |C|
    never be the same.
               |F|                |G|
   But what I then could never know,
                  |C|     |G|      |A|*m*
   The years of time began to show—
                  |C|
   What depth of love and mercy
     |F|    |G|       |C|
    You would bestow!

*2.* And though the path
    that be Your will
   Calls for times of pain
    and suffering to fulfill,
   But there is grace sufficiently
   To keep my heart in perfect peace
   And follow on through all the way
    You may lead.

*3.* I know not what the future holds,
   But I’ll trust Your will
    You’re planning to unfold.
   My days and times are
    in Your hands
   Yielding to all Your love demands
   Till on that day,
    with You by grace I shall stand.
