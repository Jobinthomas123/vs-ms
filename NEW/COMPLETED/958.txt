               |E|       |A|       |E|
*1.* Saved from sin by grace abundant,
            |B|              |E|
   On the rock You set my feet;
           |E|      |E|*/*|G#|   |A|
   With a song of joy triumphant
              |B|             |E|
   Will I praise my Savior sweet.

*Chorus:*
       |G#|            |C#|*m*
   Hallelujah! How amazing,
             |B|      |F#|     |B|
   Is the grace of God to me!
             |E|              |A|
   I’m Thy son by love unchanging,
             |E|*/*|B|     |B|    |E|
   Called to reign eternally.

*2.* Son of God by faith in Jesus,
   Buried into Thine own death,
   One with all the saints I confess,
   Matchless grace in all its depth.

*3.* Shedding forth Thy Holy Spirit
   In my heart, to grow in love;
   Abba Father, You’re my comfort
   In my journey here below.

*4.* Heir of God now by adoption,
   Seeking e’er to do Thy will,
   I do wait for my redemption—
   Wondrous joy my soul doth fill.

*5.* I shall reign with Thee forever
   On the throne as priest and king,
   See the face of God my Father,
   And sing a song that
    none can sing.
