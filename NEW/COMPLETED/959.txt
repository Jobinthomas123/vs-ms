   |A|*m*
*1.* The mighty Lord of hosts
        |G|
   Has gone out to war;
         |F|
   The victory and battle
       |E|
   Are in His hands.
                |A|*m*
   Though the enemy has come
      |G|
   Against us like a flood,
           |F|
   He’ll flee at the sound
           |E|
   Of the Captain’s command!

*Chorus:*
   |A|*m*
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   |A|*m/*|G|
   Who will go to war?
   |A|*m/*|F|
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   |E|                         |E|*7*
   Who will take up their sword?
   |A|*m*
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   |A|*m/*|G|
   Who will go to war?
   |A|*m/*|F|
   Who is on the Lord’s side?
   |E|                    |E|*7*
   To thrust out the enemy—
                 |A|*m*
   Our defeated foe.

*2.* We’re a chosen generation;
   He’s called us to fight,
   To bring every work
   Of darkness to light.
   Through our God
   We shall do valiantly;
   We’ll run through a troop
   And sweep o’er our enemies.
