*Chorus:*
   *(*|C|*)*     |F|
   “For I know My thoughts
      |G|
    toward you
         |C|                     |A|*m*
   Are thoughts of peace and faith,
        |F|
   To complete the work
         |G|            |C| *-* |C|*7*
    I started by My grace.”
                 |F|
   Lord, I will follow
              |G|
    in Your footsteps
     |C|               |A|*m*
   Until I see Your face,
           |F|
   Then forever dwell
         |G|              |C|
    in Your most holy place.

   |C|
*1.* I had wandered in darkness
   |G|                   |C|
   With no hope in my heart,
               |F|
   Then Your love shined through

    and I heard Your voice,
                         |G|
   “My son, rise up and walk.
   |F|                  |G|
   Take My hand and follow Me
   |C|                    |A|*m*
   And you’ll never go astray;
          |Bb|
   I will be your God
                           |G|
   To complete the work in you.”

*2.* I will seek You and find You
   Until my race is won.
   I know You are there beside me
   And I’m graven in Your palm.
   I’m not worthy of Your mercies,
   But I’ll hold on to Your Word.
   In Your faithfulness
   You will guide me safely home.
