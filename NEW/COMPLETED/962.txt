        |C|           |G|*/*|B|
*1.* You created the world
              |F|*/*|A|            |C|*/*|E|
    with the mention of one word,
        |F|
   And with Your touch
       |D|*m*           |G|
    it all came to be.
          |C|             |G|*/*|B|
   Everything that was done
            |F|*/*|A|             |C|*/*|E|
    went according to Your plan;
      |D|*m*
   Because of that
                            |G|
    weâ€™ll never doubt Your power.

*Chorus:*
           |C|
   May my lips never cease
        |C|*/*|F|     |F|
    to praise You;
           |F|*/*|G|        |G|
   May my heart only beat
                 |C|
    to live for You.
            |A|*m*
   May the last breath that I breathe
    |F|           |F|*m*
    be for You alone.
        |F|*/*|A|              |G|*/*|B|
   With every thought I think,
        |F|             |G|
   With every deed I do,
           |D|*m*        |G|
   May my life only be
               |C|
    to please You.

*2.* The future of my life
    is written in Your book;
   My every thought
    and prayer is known by You.
   All of my needs
    by You have been supplied;
   My life is incomplete
    without Your love.
