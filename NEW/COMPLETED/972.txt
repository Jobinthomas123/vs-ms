(Key of F)
                   F
1. Through all of time
                    Dm
   Those who have chosen
       Bb                         C
   To follow in the footsteps of Jesus,
                   F
   With hearts ablaze,
                          Dm
   Their lives they have poured out
           Bb
   A drink offering
                          C
    at the foot of the cross.
            Dm
   He is no fool who gives up
     Bb            Dm
    all he cannot keep
       Gm7                C
   For all of that which he
                F
    can never lose.

Chorus:
                     F
   Lord, I offer my life;
               Dm
   All that I am,
             Bb
   I lay it down at Your feet,
         C
   Lord Jesus.
                   F
   I give You my best
                      Dm
   And pledge all my love to You.
                     Bb
   Set my heart on fire;
                   C
   Youâ€™re all I desire.

2. Such precious souls,
   Yet lost and dying,
   Even now at the close of the ages.
   The greatest need
   Is still for more laborers;
   See the cross, see His hands,
    and His feet.
   Oh, can you feel His burden,
    hear His urgent call
   To lose your life
    and follow in His steps?
