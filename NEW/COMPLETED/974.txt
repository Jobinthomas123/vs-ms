*1.* Emptied of His glory,
    |Bb|     |C|     |F|
    God became a man
       |Bb|               |C|
   To walk on earth in ridicule
          |F|
    and shame―
     |Bb|           |A|
   A ruler yet a servant,
       |D|*m*             |G|
    a shepherd yet a lamb,
      |F|              |C|
   A man of sorrows, agony, and
     |F|
    pain.

*Chorus:*
         |G|*m –* |C|       |F|
   He is Lord! He is Lord!
         |D|*m*              |G|
   He is risen from the dead,
              |G|*m -* |C|
   And He is Lord.
          |F|         |F|*/*|A|
   Ev'ry knee shall bow,
           |Bb|       |G|*m*
    ev'ry tongue confess
         |F|      |C|        |F|
   That Jesus Christ is Lord.

*2.* Humbled and rejected,
    beaten and despised,
   Upon the cross the Son of God
    was slain.
   Just like a lamb to slaughter,
    a sinless sacrifice,
   But by His death His loss
    became our gain.

*3.* Satan's forces crumbled
    like a mighty wall.
   The stone that held Him
    in was rolled aside.
   The Prince of Life in glory
    was lifted over all;
   Now earth and heaven
    echoes with the cry.
