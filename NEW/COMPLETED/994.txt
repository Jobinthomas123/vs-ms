*Chorus:*
   |D|*m*
   In Your glory shine.

   In Your glory shine;
                    |A|*7*      |D|*m*
   Let Your beauty shine on us
    |Bb|           |D|*m*
   Bringing restoration.
    |G|*m*            |D|*m*
   Shine into our darkness
    |C|                |D|*m*
   With the light of Zion—
    |G|*m*           |D|*m*
   Granting us deliverance;
   |A|*7*             |D|*m*
   You are our salvation.

   |G|*m*           |D|*m*
*1.* Our God has spoken
    |A|            |D|*m*
   From His holy mountain,
 |G|*m-*       |D|*m*
   Sending forth
 |A|*-*               |A|*7*
   His truth and light.

*2.* Fire goes before Him
   Shining out of Zion—
   Righteous Judge
   Over His saints.

*3.* Our God is calling
   Unto all His saints—
   Gath’ring those
   Who’ve been found true.

*Bridge:*
    |G|*m*          |D|*m*
   Shine out of Zion;
     |A|           |D|*m-*|D|*7*
   Shine into my life.
    |G|*m*          |D|*m*
   Shine out of Zion;
     |A|
   Shine into my life.
