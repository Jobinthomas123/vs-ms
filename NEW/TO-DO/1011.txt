Chorus:
    Dm                      C
   You are our Helper, Adonai,
      F/A         Gm7
   Yahweh, our Deliverer,
        A7               Dm-Bb-C
    we lift our eyes to You.
   Dm                        C
   You are the only One we trust,
            F/A      Gm7
   Israel’s God, our Father
       A7              Dm
    forevermore You’ll be.

          Gm         Dm
1. In our sorrow and pain,
           Am       Dm
    Comforter You remain.
            Gm        Dm        A7
   All our hope is in You, our God.

2. When the battle is long
    and the enemy’s strong,
   You will fight
    for Your chosen ones.

3. Through the storm You will be
    home and shelter to me,
   And Your rainbow will still
    be seen.

4. Though our loved ones may flee,
    ‘til the end You will be
   Faithful, covenant-keeping God.

5. In the end we’ll be there
    in Jerusalem fair,
   Evermore with the God we love.
