2.I then shall live as one
who's learned compassion;
I've been so loved
that I'll risk loving too.
I know how fear
builds walls instead of bridges;
I'll dare to see
another's point of view.
And when relationships
demand commitment,
Then I'll be there
to care and follow through.

3.Your kingdom come
around and through and in me;
Your pow'r and glory
let them shine through me.
Your hallowed name,
oh may I bear with honor,
And may Your living kingdom
come in me.
The Bread of Life,
oh may I share with honor,
And may You feed
a hungry world through me.

Ending:
 Ab-CFm-C/E  Fm/D - C
Amen,  Amen,   Amen.
