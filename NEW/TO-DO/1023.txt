Chorus:
   A/B E
Because He lives,
  E7/G#   A
I can face tomorrow.
   E
Because He lives,
C#m7 F#m7-B
all fear is gone.
A/C#-   B/D#   E -A/F#-E/G#
Because I   know,
E7/G#  A
He holds the future
  Am6E  C#7
And life is worth the living
F#7   B7  E
Just because He lives.

A/B E
1.God sent His Son;
   E7  A
They called Him Jesus.
 E
He came to love, heal,
  F#m-B
and forgive.
E-E7
He bled and died
 A
to buy my pardon.
E   B7
An empty grave is there to prove
 E
My Savior lives.

2.And then one day
I'll cross that river;
I'll fight life's final war with pain.
And then as death
Gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory
And I'll know He reigns.
