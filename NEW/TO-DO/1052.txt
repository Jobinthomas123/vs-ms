C
I can’t stop singing,

And I can’t stop shouting
 G
Since the power fell on me.

I can’t stop singing,

And I can’t stop shouting;
 C
Jesus set me free.

The Spirit came

With tongues of fire
C7   F
And rested upon me;
 Dm
I can’t stop singing,
  EmAm
And I can’t stop shouting
Dm GC
Since the power fell on me.
