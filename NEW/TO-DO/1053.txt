Chorus:
   E   A   B  C#m
Consuming fire, fill this place;
   AE/G#
Let Your glory descend
   F#m   B
As we give You praise.
  E A  F#m
Consuming fire, revive,
   BE
Revive us again.

   E B
1.Lord, Your love is fire;
E   B
Penetrate our souls today.
 E   AG#mC#m
Restore the flame, and let it grow
  A   A/B - B7
Until others are set ablaze.

2.Lord, ignite our hearts;
Let Your fire burn we pray.
Send out Your light and purify
Until darkness flees away.

3.Lord, revive Your church;
Bring us back into Your ways.
O wake us up with the holy fire
Of Your jealous love today.
