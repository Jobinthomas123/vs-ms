1.In the resurrection morning

When the trump of God
   A/C#
shall sound,
   A/E
We shall rise,
 E7   A
We shall rise!

Then the saints

will come rejoicing

And no tears will e’er be found;
A/C#   D A/E
We shall rise,
 E7  A
We shall rise!

Chorus:
A
We shall rise,

We shall rise,

We shall rise,
C#m  D A
In the resurrection morning

When death’s prison bars

are broken,
A/C#   DA/E
We shall rise,
 E7 A
We shall rise!

2.In the resurrection morning
What a meeting it will be,
We shall rise,
We shall rise!
When our fathers and our mothers
And our loved ones we shall see
We shall rise,
We shall rise!

3.In the resurrection morning
Blessed thought it is to me,
We shall rise,
We shall rise!
I shall see my blessed Savior
Who so freely died for me,
We shall rise,
We shall rise!

4.In the resurrection morning
We shall meet Him in the air,
We shall rise,
We shall rise!
And be carried up to glory
To our home so bright and fair
We shall rise,
We shall rise!
