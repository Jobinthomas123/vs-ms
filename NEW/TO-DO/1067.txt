2.In communion with my Lord
His presence is so real;
What joy I have in knowing
That Jesus is so near.
For all my doubts and questions
His answer is my peace.
I rest in Jesus’ presence,
For He meets my every need.

3.In communion with my Lord
I’m walking every day.
It’s Jesus Who is guiding
Me in this narrow way.
No enemy can touch me;
With Jesus I am safe.
And I will never wander
If I trust Him and obey.

4.In communion with my Lord
His glory I do see;
And by the Spirit’s power
Christ’s image will be seen.
He whispers, “Cease your striving;
Surrender now to Me.
My work will be accomplished
As you’re seated at My feet.”
