1.The church’s one foundation
DmG7  C
Is Jesus Christ her Lord,
C/E   F
She is His new creation
   Dm C   G
By water and the Word.

From heav’n He came
 FC/E
and sought her
  AmDm
To be His holy bride;
C/E
With His own blood
 Fmaj7
He bought her
 Dm   G  C
And for her life He died.

2.The church shall never perish!
Her dear Lord to defend,
To guide, sustain, and cherish,
Is with her to the end:
Though there be those
who hate her,
And false sons in her pale,
Against both foe or traitor
She ever shall prevail.

3.’Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore;
Till, with the vision glorious,
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great church victorious
Shall be the church at rest.

4.O happy ones and holy—
Lord, give us grace that we
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee:
There, past the border mountains,
Where in sweet vales the bride
With Thee by living fountains
Forever shall abide!
