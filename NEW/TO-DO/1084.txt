1.There’s a longing inside
 G D/F#
This world could never satisfy;
 D   Bm
There’s a freedom we crave
 E7/G#   A
Beyond the pow’r of the grave.
   GD
When this life’s at an end,
   F#Bm
The new one merely begins—
G  Em
A place where joy overflows
   A7   D
And I find rest for my soul.

Chorus:
   E7A
How I long to see the day
G D
When earth’s shadows flee away;
E7A
In heaven’s bright light
 G   Bm
Such beauty right before my eyes.
GEm
Jesus’ face I will see
   F#m  Bm
And like Him I will be—
   B7Em G
Gone the pain and the past
  AD
I am home at last.

2.The sufferings of life,
Persecutions that arise,
They can never compare
To that great glory over there.
What may come, what may pass—
The faith inside it will last,
And it grows through the trials
Like gold, it shines in the fire.

3.When the battle is hard
And fear is gripping the heart,
Jesus will be right there;
He’s interceding in prayer.
We will see ourselves changed
Although the problems remain,
And now the hope in our souls
Each day much brighter it grows.
