E
1. My God is awesome––
B
He can move mountains,
C#m
Keep me in the valley,
A
hide me from the rain.
E
My God is awesome––
B
heals me when I’m broken,
Strength where I’ve been
C#m
weakened;
A
Forever He will reign.

Chorus:
EB
My God is awesome, awesome,
C#m A
awesome, awesome.

2. My God is awesome––
Savior of the whole world,
Giver of salvation;
by His stripes I am healed.
My God is awesome––
today I am forgiven,
His grace is why I’m living,
praise His holy name.
