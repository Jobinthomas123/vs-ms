Chorus:
A
   Bigger than all my problems,
DA
   Bigger than all my fears;
E7 A F#m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
A E – E7
   That I can or cannot see.
A
   Bigger than all my questions,
DA
   Bigger than anything;
E7 A F#m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
E7 A
   That I can or cannot see.

A
1. Bigger than all the shadows
DA
   That fall across my path;
   E7A F#m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
A E–E7
   That I can or cannot see.
A
   Bigger than all the confusion,
D A
   Bigger than anything;
E7 A F#m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
E7 A
   That I can or cannot see.

2. Bigger than all the giants––
   Fear and unbelief;
   God is bigger than any mountain
   That I can or cannot see.
   Bigger than all my hang ups,
   Bigger than anything;
   God is bigger than any mountain
   That I can or cannot see.
