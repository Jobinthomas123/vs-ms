   A
1. I was a wretch;
      F#m
    I remember who I was.
          D          A/C#
   I was lost, I was blind,
          B7             E
   I was running out of time.
    A
   Sin separated;
         F#m
    the breach was far too wide––
                 D               A/C#
   But from the far side of the chasm
        B7              E
   You held me in Your sight.

2. So You made a way
    across the great divide,
   Left behind heaven’s throne
    to build it here inside.
   There at the cross
    You paid the debt I owed,
   Broke my chains, freed my soul;
   For the first time I had hope.

Chorus:
     A
   Thank You, Jesus,
              D        A
    for the blood applied;
               F#m
   Thank You, Jesus,
            B7         E
    it has washed me white.
    F#m   E    D-A
   Thank You, Jesus,
    A/C#      D     E  F#m
    You have saved my life;
      D                A/C#
   Brought me from the darkness
         A/E - E    A
    into glorious light.

3. You took my place,
    laid inside my tomb of sin.
   You were buried for three days;
   But then
    You walked right out again!
   And now death has no sting
    and life has no end,
   For I have been transformed
     by the blood of the Lamb.

Bridge:
     D
   There is nothing stronger
             E
   Than the wonder-working power
           F#m         C#m
   Of the blood, the blood––
         D
   That calls us sons and daughters.
           E
   We are ransomed by our Father
                 F#m
   Through the blood,
          C#m (going to chorus: E)
    the blood.
