1. Hear the Lord of harvest
            C      Am
    gently calling,
             Dm      G
   “Who will go and work
        G7    C  C/F
    for Me today?
                      F
   Who will bring to Me the lost and
     C    Am
    dying?
             Dm7       G7
   Who will point them to the
            C   C7
    narrow way?”

Chorus:
              F
   Speak, my Lord
               Dm7
    (speak my Lord);
            C            Am
   Speak to me (speak to me).
              Dm7       G
   Speak, and I’ll be quick to
     G7      C
    answer Thee
                   C7
    (I’ll answer Thee).
              F
   Speak, my Lord
                Dm7
    (speak, my Lord);
             C           Am
   Speak to me (speak to me).
             Dm7      G
   Speak, and I will answer,
      G7         C  F/G
    “Lord, send me.”

2. When the coal of fire
    touched the prophet,
   Making him as pure as pure can
    be,
   When the voice of God said,
    “Who’ll go for us?”
   The he answered, “Here I am,
    send me.”

3. Millions now in sin and
    shame are dying;
   Listen to their sad and bitter cry.
   Hasten, brother, hasten to
    the rescue;
   Quickly answer, “Master,
    here am I.”

4. Soon the time for reaping
    will be over;
   Soon we’ll gather for the
    harvest-home.
   May the Lord of harvest
    smile upon us;
   May we hear His blessed,
    “Child, well done!”
