  D Bm
Whatever the problem might be
 Em7 A
God is able to solve it for you;
G   A
Jesus gave His life on the tree
D   D7
So that He might de-deliver you.
  G
Come and put your  faith in
   Em7
His blood;
 D
Let Him do what He wants
   Bm
to do in you.
 G
Just open your  heart now
   A
to Him,
  G  D
For our God is able.  (End)

   G   A
Sometimes we think that
 D
we can solve
G A  D
Our problems in our way;
G   A  Bm
Instead of running unto Him,
E7  A4-A7
Oh, we turn and run away.
