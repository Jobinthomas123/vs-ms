1.There is peace and contentment
   F Fm6C
in the Father’s house today.
C Am7
Abundant food on the table
 Dm G
and no one is turned away.
   C C7
There is singing and laughter
   F C/E Dm
as the hours  pass  by;
C/G   Am
Then a hush calms the singing
 Dm7   GC
at the Father’s mournful cry:

Chorus:
  C  F
My house is full,
C  Am
but My field is empty.
C  Am7
Who will go and work
Dm7   G
for Me today?
 CF
My children, hear the cry
   C   Am
of a million precious souls.
C Dm7  G
Who will go and show them
E7   Am7
the Way?
Fm7  C  Dm7  Dm7/G
Who will go and show them
 C
the Way?

2.Lift your eyes from the table;
look out through the
windowpane.
Just beyond this house of plenty
lies a field of golden grain.
It is ripened unto harvest;
but the reapers, where are they?
In the house—oh, can’t the children
hear the Father sadly say:

3.Many hopeless souls are crying.
Who will go and win the lost?
Soon the harvest will be over.
Will you quickly count the cost?
Will your life be dry and barren?
Will you hang your head in
shame?
As a million souls are dying
With no knowledge of My name.

4.You have just one life,
My children;
That so soon will pass away.
When you stand here in
My presence,
Oh, what will you ever say?
Have you lived for your own
pleasure?
Will your gain be turned to loss?
Can’t you see the crown of glory?
Won’t you now take up your
cross?

5.Come, forsake your all,
My children;
Bear your cross and follow Me.
I have shown you life eternal;
From this present darkness flee.
Lay a hold upon the glory;
Come and follow in My way
Then I’ll own you as My servants
In that bright, eternal day.
