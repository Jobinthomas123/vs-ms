O Jesus, I now hear Thy voice

calling me
 Gm  A
To forsake my all,

and follow Thee;

To go where Thou sendest,

to labor for Thee—
 Gm—ADm
O Lord… send me!

   Bb   Gm
And I will rise up and follow,
  A   Dm
follow the Lamb.
Gm  C
I will do all Thy will
  DmD7/F#
and give all that I am.
   GmC
My heart’s one desire,
FDm
Thy servant to be,
 Gm—ADm
O Lord… send me!
