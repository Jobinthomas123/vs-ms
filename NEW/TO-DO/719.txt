Saving, helping, keeping, loving—
  D G Em   DAD
He is with me   to the end.

2.Jesus! What a strength in weakness!
Let me hide myself  in  Him.
Tempted, tried, and
sometimes failing,
He, my strength, my vict’ry wins.

3.Jesus! What a help in sorrow
While the billows o’er me roll.
Even when my heart is breaking,
He, my comfort, helps my soul.

4.Jesus! What a Guide and Keeper
While the tempest still is high.
Storms about me,
night o’ertakes me,
He, my Pilot, hears my cry.

5.Jesus! I do now receive Him,
More than all in Him I find;
He hath granted me forgiveness;
I am His, and He is mine.
