1.Pass me not, O gentle Savior;
   B   B7  E  –E/A
Hear my humble cry.
  EC#m
While on others Thou art calling,
F#m  B B7  E
Do not pass me by.

Chorus:
  E   E7A  F#m7
Savior, Savior,
   E   C#m  F#m7 –B
Hear my humble cry;
E   C#m
While on others Thou art calling,
  F#m7  B B7  E
Do not pass me by.

2.Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my un—be—lief.

3.Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face.
Heal my wounded, broken spirit;
Save me by Thy grace.

4.Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth
beside Thee?
Whom in heav’n but Thee?
