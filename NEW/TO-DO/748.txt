   Em Em/D
   Take me past the outer court
Cmaj7
    and through the Holy Place,
  D
   Past the brazen altar,
  Em   D
    Lord, I want to see Your face.
           Em Em/D
   Pass me by the crowds of people
             Cmaj7
    and the priests that sing

    their praise;
      D
   I hunger and thirst

    for Your righteousness,
    Am7                    C/D
   But itâ€™s only found one place.

Chorus:
              Em
   So take me into the
             D/E
    Holy of Holies;
           Am7       Am7/D
   Take me in by the blood
            Em-Cmaj7
    of the Lamb.
      C/D     Em
   So take me into the
             D/E
    Holy of Holies;
            Am7    Am/D      A/B
   Take the coal, cleanse my lips,
     B     Em
    here I am.
