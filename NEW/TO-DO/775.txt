Chorus:
  D Bm
Give ear to my words, O Lord,
EmA
and consider my meditation. x2
   F# Bm
Hearken to the voice of my cry,

my God,
  Em  A4 - A
For unto You will I pray.
  F#Bm
And in the morning you shall hear

my voice;
   Em  A4 - A
I will direct my prayer to You
 D
And will look up.

  D  D4-D
1.Whom have I in heaven but You?

And upon this earth there’s
Bm Em A
nothing I desire besides You.
  G   A
My flesh and my heart fail,
F#mBm
but God is my strength,
  EE/G#
Therefore I will lift
   A–A7
my eyes to You.

2.It is good to draw  near  unto God.
And because He is faithful,
in His name I place my trust.
For He has been my fortress,
My help in time of need;
With great hope
I wait for Him to come.
