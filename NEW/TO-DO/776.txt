D F#m
Teach me, O Lord,
   G A
the way of Your statutes;
D F#m
Give me understanding,
G A
and I will keep Your law.
G  A
Direct me in the path of
 DA/C#Bm
Your commands.
EmA
Incline my heart to
  D  Am7D7
Your decrees.
G A
Turn away my eyes from
   DA/C#   Bm
beholding vanity,
  Em   A   D
And quicken me  in Your way.
