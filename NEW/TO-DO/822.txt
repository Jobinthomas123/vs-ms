2.I am resolved to go to the Savior,
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One,
He is the just One,
He hath the words of life.

3.I am resolved to follow the Savior,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth,
Do what He willeth—
He is the living way.

4.I am resolved
to enter the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin.
Friends may oppose me;
Foes may beset me.
Still will I enter in.
