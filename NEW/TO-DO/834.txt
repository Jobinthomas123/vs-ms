Chorus:
  EB
Great joy, great joy to the
E B  A
ones who stand with God;
  E B
Great joy, great joy
   EA
flooding through my soul.
E   B
Though the gates of hell
 B/D#   C#m
come against my soul,
 A
With the saints of God
F#m B4 – B7
I will prevail.
 E  B
Great joy, great joy
   A B   E
flooding through my soul.

   A   BB7E
1.With promised joy for every trial,
   E  B-B7 E  —E7
I’ll firmly take my stand;
   A   B
For grace abounds
  B7   C#m
and glory, too—
C#m/A   F#m   B4—B
All from God’s own hand.

2.All through the day and
through the night,
With joy I’ve made my choice;
In times of pain or suff’ring loss,
It’s then I will rejoice.

3.I want to live above the world,
With hope I’ve set  my eyes;
And when He comes,
I’ll go with Him
To my home beyond the skies.
