Chorus:
   G  C DG
Going onward, pressing forward
C  GC-D-G
On God’s highway of holiness.
  C
Reaching higher,
  D G
my vision brighter,
C G C   DG
As I’m following in His steps.

D D7
1.To win the prize
   G CG
of this great high calling—
D  D7
My goal, my aim
 C D
to be found in Christ.

2.What things were gain
I will count as loss now—
Forsaking all,
taking up the cross.

3.With banner raised,
lifting high the standard—
His truth proclaim,
glorious victory.

4.A race to run,
filled with grace and glory—
At journey’s end
I shall see His face.
