 Em
1.From the time
   Am
that You first saved me,
   Dm   G
You have been so good to me.
  Em
You have healed me,
  Am
and You’ve filled me;
Dm G
You’ve supplied my every need.
 Esus   E/G#
Now I’ve been told that I can go
  AmD7/F#
Through the door and I’ll be free,
 Dm7   C/E
But in my heart I know
   F   F/A  Gsus - G
just where I want to be.

Chorus:
  F-GC   C/E
Pierce my ear at Your door,
F  G
For I’m Your slave
   Am   G/B  C
and You’re my Lord.
   F –G C  Am
Forever I’ll  obey Your voice.
FC
My Lord and Master,
   Dm7  G  Am
to serve You I rejoice;
  DmC/E
Forever I am Yours—
  Fmaj7   G  C
I have made my choice.

2.You have fed me
and You’ve clothed me
With Your robe of righteousness;
You’ve been a very present help
When I called in my distress.
With every spiritual gift in Christ,
I know that I’ve been blessed.
How could I ever think
to give You any less?

3.I will live now for Your glory;
In Your service I’ll be spent.
Yes, I know there will be trials,
But Your joy will be my strength.
Though others have
gone out the door,
I’ll not go as they went;
For at the door is where
I made my covenant.
