1.Before the throne of God above
 A
I have a strong and perfect pleaâ€”
 G
A great High Priest
   A  Bm
whose name is Love,
GA   D
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
   G DA
My name is graven in His hands;
   G  A D
My name is written on His heart.
   GA
I know that while in heaven
  Bm
He stands,
  G
No tongue can bid me
   A D
thence depart;
  G
No tongue can bid me
  A   D
thence depart.

2.When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin.
Because the sinless Savior died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me,
To look on Him and pardon me.

3.Behold Him there: the risen Lamb,
My perfect spotless righteousness,
The great unchangeable I AM,
The King of glory and of grace.
One with Himself, I cannot die;
My soul is purchased
with His blood.
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ my Savior
and my God,
With Christ my Savior
and my God.
