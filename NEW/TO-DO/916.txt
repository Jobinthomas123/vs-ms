Chorus:
 CAm
I’m falling in love
 Dm7  G
with Your holiness;
 C   Am
I’m lifting my hands
 Dm7 G
to Your righteousness.
  F C/E
These are the gifts
  E7   Am7
that my heart was made for;
  F  C/E
These are the things
 Dm7  G
that Your heart will bless.
C Am
I give You my body,
 Dm7  G
my heart, and my mind;
C Am
Please pattern them after
   Dm7  G
Your master design,
  F  C/E
Till all that’s within me
Am D
will only express
Dm7   C
My love for Your beautiful
 GC
holiness.

F  C
1.You saved me,
 G  C
cleansed me from sin;
  FC
You forgave me,
  G   C
gave life within.
  F C/E
Joy filled my heart
 E7   Am
unlike ever before—
  F  C/E
Yet still I cried,
Dm7G
“Is there more?”

2.You gave peace
when I met You;
You amazed me
with all You could do.
Your holy light,
it shined upon me:
I heard the call
to purity.

3.I desire
to be like You,
Your holy fire
refining me through
Until You say,
“Well done, My child;
You are My love,
My undefiled!”
