Chorus:
D   D/F#G D
All of You, filling all of me;
  Bm Bm/A   Em - A
More of You, Lord, let me see.
 G D
For this world and its gain
 BmE/G#
Is but empty and vain—
   Em   A  D
Only Your love could ever satisfy.

 G  A
1.For what more could I ask
 G   D
From One Who’s given so much?
Bm   Bm/A
I’ve been blessed in this life
D/F#G A
Filled with glory and grace.
 Bm A/F#
Oh, and yet, there’s a cry
 GEm
From the depth of my heart;
 D/F#   G
There is more, so much more
  A4   A
of Your love.

2.To Your presence I come,
Emptied of self and vain pride,
To receive from Your hand
All You richly provide;
Not for good I have done,
But because You are good—
All I need
flows to bring me new life.

3.Though the path of Your will
May lead to sorrow and pain,
Yet I’ll cling to the One
Who said, “My peace I give.”
And I’ll look to the cross
Where You suffered and died,
Till I rise to my home in the skies.
