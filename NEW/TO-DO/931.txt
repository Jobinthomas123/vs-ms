E C#m
1.Long before the world’s creation,
  A F#m
Long before all time began,
A  E/G#
In the mind of God the Father
   F#m   BE
Was a great eternal plan.
B C#m
It was sacred, it was glorious,
  F#m   B
It was graven in His hands—
  A
That some saints would
   E/G#
follow Jesus,
  F#mB
And on Zion with Him
E
would stand.

Chorus:
 AE
Blessed Zion, holy Zion,
C#m
Fill my heart, Lord,
  B
with Your love.
  A F#m
I will follow You to Zion;
  A  B  E
I will join the saints above.

2.Gladly leaving home and family,
Nothing left to call their own,
They have made the Lord
their portion:
They are bound to Him alone.
Choosing only things
which please Him,
On the Holy Mount they pray;
How the love of God does
keep them
In His presence night and day!

3.Dedicated to be holy,
In their minds from sin they turn;
God is satisfied with gladness,
For in Zion His fire does burn.
Cry and shout, oh son of Zion;
Wield the sword for Christ,
your King.
None will ever understand you
Till on Zion you start to sing.

4.Broken in the vale of weeping,
Some do stumble in their race;
But the Lord will comfort Zion,
Building every wasted place.
Giving beauty for their ashes,
He’ll be gracious unto them,
Till they shine a crown of glory
And a royal diadem.

5.Rise, My servants, I am with you;
What I’ve promised I will do.
With great zeal I’ll fight for Zion
And My work complete in you.
Rise and thresh, daughter of Zion;
Do not weep and do not fear.
I’m your God, I’ll build up Zion,
And for you I will appear.
