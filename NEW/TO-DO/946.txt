CG/B
1.Though a host encamps
   Am
against me,
  F   G
In this I will stand strong;
C G/B
Though a war should rise
Am
against my soul,
 Dm Am  G
I know where I belong.
  Dm G
My desire is one thing,
G/E
And that one thing
 Am
will I seek for—
FC/E
To dwell all of my days
 Dm7D/F# G4G
In the house of the Lord.

Chorus:
C/E F  G4  GC  Am
To behold the beauty of You—
   F  Am
All that You are thrilling my heart,
Dm F G
Until all that I can do
 C/E  F   G  Am
Is to adore the glory of You.
 Dm Am
Oh, Lord, all of my days
DmAm
I will worship, I will praise
  Dm   GG/B   C
The glorious beauty of You.

2.There were many other beauties
That once my heart longed for,
But they've been displaced
by just one thing—
The glory of the Lord.
Such as eye has never seen
Nor human heart
could understand—
The grandeur and glory
In the things that God has planned.

3.Every storm will soon be over,
Our trials turned to gold,
When the Lord shall come
and rapture us
To worship at His throne.
Oh the fire of His love—
I’ll see the glory of that place!
For this, I have chosen
To forever seek His face.
