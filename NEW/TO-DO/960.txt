  A   E
1.Down the mountain
 B  E
the river flows,
A   E
And it brings refreshing
B E
wherever it goes.
   A   E
Through the valleys
  B  E
and over the fields,
 A   E
The river is rushing
   BE
and the river is here.

Chorus:
E
The river of God
 AE
Sets our feet a-dancing;
 E
The river of God
   B E
Fills our hearts with cheer.
  E
The river of God
 AE
Fills our mouths with laughter,
 AE
And we rejoice
   B E
For the river is here.

2.The river of God
is teeming with life,
And all who touch it
can be revived;
And all who linger
on this river's shore
Will come back thirsting
for more of the Lord!

3.Up to the mountain
we love to go
To find the presence
of the Lord.
Along the banks
of the river we run;
We dance with laughter
giving praise to the Son.
