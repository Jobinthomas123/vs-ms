  Dm
1.Time after time,
  C/E   Am
I know that I’ve let You down.
F
Broken promises surround me
 C/E  Dm
and lay me at Your feet.
  Dm
But, somehow Your words
EmAm
find a way to my hurting heart:
  F
“The work that I have started,
 G
I promise to complete.”

Chorus:
  C/E  F
To be faithful unto death,
G   C
I will give my life.
C/E  F
No greater love,
 G Am
No greater sacrifice
 F
Than giving my all
C/E  Dm
To the One Who is calling,
   C Bb
Who will keep me from falling,
   F G
Who enables me to say;
   Dm Em
"Until my last breath
  F
I will be faithful,
  G C
Faithful unto death."

2. In weakness I find
that Your strength is all I need;
At the end of all my struggles,
there is grace that carries me.
The more that I die,
the more that You live in me;
All the glory goes to You, Lord,
for every victory.

3. “Not I, but Christ”
is the secret that I’ve found;
And Your grace is now abounding,
supplying every need.
A most holy faith is
the strength of this failing heart,
And now Christ Who lives within me makes this bold decree:

Bridge:
 F  GC
I will go where You go,
   F G  Am
I will stay where You stay,
  F   G
Neither life nor death
  Am   F
Could ever keep me away
G
From You.
