1.How firm a foundation,
B
Ye saints of the Lord,
   E  AE/G#
Is laid for your faith
   C#m   E/C#-B-B7 E
In His excellent Word.
  B/D#  C#m
What more can He  say
   EB
Than to you He hath said—
  A   E/G#-C#m
To you who for ref - uge
 E/B-B7 E
To Jesus have fled?

2.Fear not, I am with thee;
O be not dismayed.
For I am thy God;
I will still give thee aid.
I'll strengthen thee, help thee,
And cause thee to stand—
Upheld by My gracious
Omnipotent hand.

3.In every condition,
In sickness, in health,
In poverty's vale,
Or abounding in wealth,
At home and abroad,
On the land, on the sea—
As thy days may demand
Shall thy strength ever be.

4.When through the deep waters
He calls thee to go,
The rivers of grief
Shall not thee overflow;
For He will be with thee
In trouble to bless
And sanctify to thee
Thy deepest distress.

5.When through fiery trials
Thy pathway shall lie,
My grace all-sufficient
Shall be thy supply.
The flames shall not hurt thee;
I only design
Thy dross to consume
And thy gold to refine.

6.The soul that on Jesus
Hath leaned for repose
I will not, I will not
Desert to its foes.
That soul, though all hell
Should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no never,
No never forsake.
