Hearing Him call,

Finding Him from day to day
Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

3.Tho' a vessel I may be—
Broken and small,
broken and small.
Yet His blessings fall on me
Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.

4.When I reach the crystal sea
Voices will call, voices will call.
But my Savior's voice will be
Sweeter than all, sweeter than all.
