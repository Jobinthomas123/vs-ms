             |2|
I am free, free, free,
                      |9|
The Lord has set me free.

I have met a Man,
                |2|
A Man from Galilee.

He took away my sins,
    |2|7            |7|
My heavy load of sin;
                |2|
And now I am rejoicing,
             |9|     |2|
I am free, free, free.
