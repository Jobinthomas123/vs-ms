 |4| |9|    |11|7 |4|     —|4|7
Because He lives,
               |9|    —|6|7
 I can face tomorrow.
            |4|   —|1|m
Because He lives,
              |6|7 —|11|7
 all fear is gone;
            |4| - |11|7 - |4|7
Because I know,
               |9|    —|6|7
 He holds the future,
             |4|        |1|7
And life is worth the living
  |6|7     |11|7      |4|
 just because He lives.
