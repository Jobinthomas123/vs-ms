             |9|           |9|7
1. I don’t know about tomorrow;
            |2|                |9|
    I just live from day to day.
            |2|
   I don’t borrow from its sunshine,
              |11|7                |4|7
    for its skies may turn to gray.
            |9|             |9|7
   I don’t worry o’er the future,
           |2|               |9|
    for I know what Jesus said;
           |2|              |9|
   And today I’ll walk beside Him,
                      |4|7   |9|
    for He knows what is ahead.

Chorus
   |9|7     |2|             |9|
   Many things about tomorrow,
             |11|7            |4|7
    I don’t seem to understand;
          |9|                |2|
   But I know Who holds tomorrow,
           |9|       |4|7       |9|
   And I know Who holds my hand.

2. Ev’ry step is getting brighter
    as the golden stairs I climb.
   Ev’ry burden’s getting lighter;
    ev’ry cloud is silver-lined.
   There the sun is always shining;
    there no tear will dim the eye—
   At the ending of the rainbow,
   Where the mountains touch
    the sky.

3. I don’t know about tomorrow;
    it may bring me poverty.
   But, the One Who feeds
    the sparrow
   Is the One Who stands by me.
   And, the path that be my portion,
   May be through the flame
    or flood;
   But His presence goes before me,
   And I’m covered with His blood.
