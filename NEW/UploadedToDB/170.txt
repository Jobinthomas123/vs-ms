2. Holy, holy, holy!
   All the saints adore Thee—
   Casting down their golden crowns
    around the glassy sea.
   Cherubim and seraphim
    falling down before Thee,
   Which wert, and art,
    and evermore shalt be.

3. Holy, holy, holy!
   Tho’ the darkness hide Thee,
   Tho’ the eye of sinful man
    Thy glory may not see.
   Only Thou art holy;
   There is none beside Thee—
   Perfect in pow’r, in love,
    and purity.

4. Holy, holy, holy,
   Lord God Almighty!
   All Thy works shall praise
    Thy name,
   In earth, and sky, and sea.
   Holy, holy, holy,
   Merciful and Mighty!
   God in three Persons,
    blessed Trinity!
