   Thou art the Potter;
    |9|          |2|
    I am the clay.
                |7|    |2|
   Mold me and make me
    |2|7         |7|
    after Thy will,
               |2|  |11|m
   While I am waiting
     |4|m      |9|    |2|
    yielded and still.

2. Have Thine own way, Lord!
   Have Thine own way!
   Search me and try me,
    Master, today!
   Whiter than snow, Lord,
    wash me just now,
   As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

3. Have Thine own way, Lord!
   Have Thine own way!
   Wounded and weary,
    help me, I pray!
   Power, all power, surely is Thine!
   Touch me and heal me,
    Saviour Divine!

4. Have Thine own way, Lord!
   Have Thine own way!
   Hold oâ€™er my being
    absolute sway!
   Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
   Christ only, always, living in me.
