1. No reputation, with Jesus I go,

   Willingly, cheerfully,
     |7|          |9|
    my life to sow.
    |2|          |2|7
   Sow to the Spirit,
        |7|            |2|
    in faith lay it down;

   Strive for the mastery,
          |9|7       |2|
    hope for the crown.

2. No reputation, if Jesus had none,
   Why should I murmur,
    the suffering shun?
   Why from the cross
    should I seek for release?
   I must diminish
    for Him to increase.

3. No reputation
    but with Him I crave,
   Glory immortal,
    beyond the dark grave.
   Honor and glory,
    which never can fade,
   Scorners are silent,
    there’s none to upbraid.

4. No reputation and unrecognized,
   Misunderstood, and by
    worldlings despised;
   God understands me—
    this thought will suffice,
   Bearing the cross,
    I should ever rejoice.

5. No reputation
    with Him I’m content,
   Laying my life down
    to spend and be spent.
   Living or dying, I will not refrain,
   God cannot lie,
    I shall take it again.
