Chorus:
            |2|
   Oh, the Holy Ghost will set
                 |9|7
    your feet a dancing;

   The Holy Ghost will thrill you
                   |2|
    through and through.

   Oh, the Holy Ghost will set
                  |7|     -|4|m
    your feet a dancing,
        |9|                |9|7     |2|
   And set your heart a dancing too.

    |2|
1. David danced before the Lord;
        |9|7
    he danced with all his mighty.

   His heart was filled with holy joy;
           |9|           |2|
    his spirit was so light.

   Michal through

    the window looked,
         |7|             |4|m
    to criticize did start,
        |9|
   She didn’t understand that David
     |9|7            |2|
    had a dancing heart.

2. David danced before the Lord
    to magnify His name.
   In God’s almighty presence,
    he felt no sense of shame.
   The oil of gladness flowed that
    day; it quickened every part.
   He hadn’t only dancing feet!
    he had a dancing heart.

3. Out of Egypt long ago
    the Israelites were led,
   And by a mighty miracle
    they all were kept and fed.
   Through the Red sea
    they were brought;
   The waters stood apart,
   And God gave sister Miriam
    a dance down in her heart.

4. There was a celebration
    upon the Red Sea shore;
   Timbrels rang and desert sands
    became a dancing floor.
   The people sang
    and praised God there;
   He made the gloom depart,
   And put a dance of love and joy,
    a-deep down in their hearts.

5. The prodigal was far away,
    wand’ring out in sin.
   But, he came back to
    father’s house,
   And father took him in.
   He put a robe upon his son;
    the merriment did start.
   The prodigal got dancing shoes
    to match his dancing heart.

6. The father’s house with music
    rang to welcome home the son;
   Wine was flowing full and free,
    all misery was gone.
   The elder brother looking on
    complained it wasn’t fair.
   He hadn’t got a dancing heart
    like all the others there.

7. Now many saints are cold
    and bound by unbelief today;
   They want the blessing of the Lord
    but worry what men say.
   Oh, let the Lord have full control;
    from dead traditions part.
   And, He will set you free within;
    you’ll have a dancing heart.

8. Now in the Bible we can read
    that in the latter days
   Men would leave their first love,
    yes, and turn to carnal ways.
   But, true-born saints of Jesus,
    for the Bridegroom set apart,
   Are waiting for His coming,
    with a joyful dancing heart.
