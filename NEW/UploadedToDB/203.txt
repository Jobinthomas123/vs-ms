1. Jesus stands amongst us

    as the great Healer

   For the sick in body,
              |11|7
    soul and mind;
            |4|
   He was bruised,
            |4|7
    He was wounded,
           |9|              |6|m7
   So that in Him you may find
            |4|         |11|7     |4|
   Perfect healing of every kind.

Chorus:
   |4|
   All your weakness,

    all your sorrow,

   All your sicknesses
           |11|7
    were laid on Him.
    |4|
   Come believing,

    never doubting,
                         |11|7  |4|
   There’s abundant life in Him.

2. Jesus stands amongst us
    with mighty power,
   And as ointment poured forth
    is His name.
   He can free you from all your care
   And make you fully whole—
   Changing never, the great ‘I AM’.

3. Jesus stands amongst us
    with deep compassion,
   Eagerly to touch
    the suffering ones.
   Sorely scourged, He has suffered,
   And He knows your every need.
   Healing virtue from Him
    e’er comes.

4. Jesus stands amongst us,
    despised, rejected
   On the cross with bleeding
    hands and feet.
   As the serpent that Moses
    in the desert lifted up,
   Christ has taken
    the curse complete.
