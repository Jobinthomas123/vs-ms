                  |4|            |9|
1. I’m pressing on the upward way;
                    |4|
   New heights I’m gaining every
     |11|7
    day.
                 |4|              |9|
   Still praying as I’m onward bound,
                    |4|
   “Lord, plant my feet
           |11|7   |4|
    on higher ground.”

Chorus:
                 |4|               |11|7
   Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
                               |4|
   By faith, on heaven’s table-land—
              |4|7               |9|
   A higher plane than I have found.
                   |4|
   Lord, plant my feet
           |11|7   |4|
    on higher ground.

2. My heart has no desire to stay
   Where doubts arise
    and fears dismay.
   Tho’ some may dwell
    where these abound,
   My prayer, my aim,
    is higher ground.

3. I want to live above the world,
   Tho’ Satan’s darts at me are
    hurled.
   For, faith has caught
    the joyful sound,
   The song of saints
    on higher ground.

4. I want to scale the utmost height
   And catch a gleam of glory bright.
   But, still I’ll pray
    till heav’n I’ve found,
   “Lord, lead me on
    to higher ground.”
