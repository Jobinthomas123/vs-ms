1. Have you been to Jesus

    for the cleansing power?
                           |4|m
   Are you washed in the blood
            |9|m – |2|7
    of the Lamb?
            |7|
   Are you fully trusting
             |0|         |9|m
    in His grace this hour?
            |7|
   Are you washed in the blood
    |2|       |7|
    of the Lamb?

Chorus:
            |7|              |0| - |9|m
   Are you washed in the blood,
           |7|               |4|m
   In the soul-cleansing blood
            |9|m – |2|7
    of the Lamb?
             |7|
   Are your garments spotless?
              |0|       |9|m
   Are they white as snow?
             |7|
   Are you washed in the blood
    |2|       |7|
    of the Lamb?

2. Are you walking daily
    by the Savior’s side?
   Are you washed in the blood
    of the Lamb?
   Do you rest each moment
    in the Crucified?
   Are you washed in the blood
    of the Lamb?

3. When the Bridegroom cometh
    will your robes be white?
   Are you washed in the blood
    of the Lamb?
   Will your soul be ready
    for the mansions bright?
   And be washed in the blood
    of the Lamb?

4. Lay aside the garments
    that are stained with sin.
   Are you washed in the blood
    of the Lamb?
   There’s a fountain flowing
    for the soul unclean;
   Oh, be washed in the blood
    of the Lamb.
