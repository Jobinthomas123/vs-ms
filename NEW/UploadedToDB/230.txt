1. Amazing grace—
          |0|        |7|
    how sweet the sound
                 |4|m         |2|7
   That saved a wretch like me!
     |7|         |7|7
   I once was lost
        |0|       |7|
    but now am found,
                      |2|  |7|
   Was blind, but now I see.

2. ‘Twas grace that taught
    my heart to fear,
   And grace my fears relieved.
   How precious did
    that grace appear
   The hour I first believed!

3. Thro’ many dangers,
    toils and snares,
   I have already come.
   ‘Tis grace hath brought me
    safe thus far,
   And grace will lead me home.

4. When we’ve been there
    ten thousand years—
   Bright shining as the sun.
   We’ve no less days
    to sing God’s praise
   Than when we first begun.
