1. This Christmas story is so real
             |2|              |11|7
    and so precious now to me;
                |4|
   It fills my heart with heavenly joy
              |9| - |4|
    all year long.
             |9|
   For, its message of God’s love
                |2|              |11|7
    caused my blinded eyes to see;
                 |9|              |4|7
   And this is why that I now sing
                    |9| – |4|
    this Christmas song:

Chorus:
     |9|                    |2|
   Thank You, Lord, for Christmas;
               |11|
   Thank You, Father, for giving
          |4|
    Your Son.
         |9|         |9|aug
   And, thank You, Lord,
            |2| – |11|7
    for salvation.
               |9|
   Thank You, Jesus,
          |4|7           |9|
    for what You have done!

2. And, when I think of Christ my
    Lord in a stable, dark and cold
   Tears of joy, they fill my heart
    each time it’s told!
   For, I know the reason why
    that my Lord was born to die:
   That by His blood, He might
    redeem one such as I!

3. Only a little time ago,
    I was lost in all my sin,
   Though I tried so hard
    to be just like Him.
   Then at last, but not too late,
    as I saw my wretched state
   He washed me clean and then
    He called me His own child!

4. Through all eternity I’I1 say,
   “Thank You, Lord, for Christmas
    Day!”
   For, in heaven I’ll see my Savior
    face to face.
   Yes, till I  see His nail-scarred
    hands
   And His feet and
    sword-pierced side;
   “Lord, what great love on Calvary
    for me You died!”

5. Well, now this story is so true
    and my friend it is for you
   If you are tired of this life
    of sin and shame.
   For, His blood has mighty power
    to wash you clean this very hour;
   And may this Christmas song
    be yours to sing today!
