Keep me true, Lord Jesus,
         |9|
Keep me true.

Keep me true, Lord Jesus,
          |2|
Keep me true.
                           |2|7
There’s a race that I must run;
           |7|               |2|
There are vict’ries to be won,
                     |9|7
Give me power every hour,
          |2|
  to be true!
