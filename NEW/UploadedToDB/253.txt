1. What Child is this
         |2|
    Who laid to rest,
        |0|             |11|7
   On Mary’s lap is sleeping?
         |4|m
   Whom angels greet
         |2|
    with anthems sweet,
           |0|       |11|7
   While shepherds watch
         |4|m
    are keeping.
     |7|             |2|
   This, this is Christ the King,
          |0|
   Whom shepherds guard
        |11|7
    and angels sing.
    |7|                |2|
   Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
        |0|         |11|7    |4|m
   The Babe, the Son of Mary!

2. Why lies He in such mean estate,
   Where ox and ass are feeding?
   Good Christian,
    fear for sinners here,
   The silent Word is pleading.
   Nails, spear, shall pierce
    Him through—
   The cross be borne,
    for me, for you.
   Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
   The Babe, the Son of Mary!

3. So, bring Him incense,
    gold and myrrh.
   Come peasant king, to own Him.
   The King of kings
    salvation brings;
   Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
   Raise, raise the song on high.
   The virgin sings her lullaby.
   Joy, joy for Christ is born,
   The Babe, the Son of Mary!
