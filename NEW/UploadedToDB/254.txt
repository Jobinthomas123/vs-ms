1. O come, O come, Emmanuel,
        |7|             |9|m |11|m |4|m
   And ransom captive Is—ra—el
         |9|m              |4|m |2|-|9|  |2|
   That mourns in lonely ex—ile here

   Until the Son of God ap—pear.

   Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
          |7|        |0|     |9|m |11|m  |4|m
   Shall come to thee, O Is—ra—el!

2. O come, Thou Wisdom
    from on high,
   And order all things, far and nigh;
   To us the path of knowledge show,
   And cause us in her ways to go.
   Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
   Shall come to thee, O Israel!

3. O come, Desire of nations, bind
   All peoples in one heart and mind;
   Bid envy, strife,
    and quarrels cease.
   Fill the whole world
    with heaven’s peace.
   Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
   Shall come to thee, O Israel!
