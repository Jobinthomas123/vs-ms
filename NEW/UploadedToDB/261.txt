2. Lion of Judah come to earth,
   I want to thank You for Your
    birth,
   For Your living Word,
   For Your death on the tree,
   For Your resurrection victory.
   Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

3. Lion of Judah come again,
   Take up Your throne, Jerusalem.
   Bring relief to this earth,
   And the consummation
   Of Your kingdom’s reign
    let it come.
   Maranatha! Maranatha!
