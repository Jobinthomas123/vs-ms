|2|
I am covered over with
    |2|maj7
the robe of righteousness
           |4|m       |9|
That Jesus gives to me,
 |4|m      |9|
gives to me.
|4|m
I am covered over with
       |9|7
the precious blood of Jesus,
        |2|
And He lives in me, lives in me.

What a joy it is to know
   |2|maj7           |2|7
My heav’nly Father loves me so
   |7|              |4|m
He gives to me my Jesus.
  |2|              |11|m
When He looks at me,
             |4|m             |9|
He sees not what I used to be
             |7|—|2|
But He sees Jesus.
