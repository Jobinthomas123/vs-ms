1. Awake, O Israel,
                  |9|m
    put off your slumber,
            |4|m                 |11|7
   And the truth shall set you free.
                |4|m
   For, out of Zion,
                 |9|m
    comes your Deliverer
          |4|m      |11|7  |4|m
   In the Year of Jubilee.

2. For, in the furnace
    of much affliction,
   I have chosen thee, behold!
   And for iron, I’ll give you silver,
   And for brass, I’ll give you gold.

3. Thou art My chosen,
    for I have sought thee.
   Thou art graven in My hands,
   And I will gather
    all those that gather
   And return them to their land.
