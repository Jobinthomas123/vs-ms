1. Streams of mercy now abounding,
             |7|        |9|7    |2|
   Grace for all rich and free;
            |7|                  |0|
   Christ invites you to the fountain,
           |7|  |2|-|7|
   Come to Calvary.

Chorus:
     |7|          |0|-|7|
   Christ of Calvary,
        |0|  |7|      |2|   |7|
   My soul longs for Thee;

   How my heart will thrill
         |0| - |9|m
    with rapture,
         |7|       |2|  |7|
   When Thy face I see!

2. Set at nought, O Lamb of Calvary,
   Spat upon and wounded sore—
   Thy dear back was lacerated,
   Lo, at Calvary.

3. Yea, oppressed, mocked
    and afflicted,
   Pierced with cruel thorns for me—
   Oh, Thy life to me is precious,
   Christ of Calvary.

4. Thou to lowest depths descended,
   From my sins to ransom me.
   Now Thy love supreme
    enthralleth,
   Christ of Calvary.

5. Free from sin,
   my soul cleaves to Thee.
   Once an alien, now Thy child—
   Thou immortal great Jehovah,
   Christ of Calvary.

6. He, to God’s right hand exalted,
   Ever pleadeth there for me.
   Sin and death,
   He now hath conquered,
   Christ of Calvary.
