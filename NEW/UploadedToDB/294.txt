He is the Rock,

And His work is perfect;
|7|                 |2|
All His ways are judgment.

A God of truth
        |2|       |11|m
And without iniquity,
|4|m       |9|        |2|
Just and right is He.
|2|        |9|        |2|
Just and right is He (Hallelujah!),
|7|                 |2|
Just and right is He.
   |7|
A God of truth
        |2|       |11|m
And without iniquity,
|4|m        |9|       |2|
Just and right is He.
