2. Fair are the meadows;
   Fair are the woodlands
   Robed in flowers
    of blooming spring.
   Jesus is fairer; Jesus is purer.
   He makes our sorrowing spirit
    sing.

3. Fair is the sunshine;
   Fair is the moonlight,
   Bright the sparkling stars on high.
   Jesus shines brighter;
   Jesus shines purer
   Than all the angels in the sky.

4. Beautiful Savior,
   Lord of all nations,
   Son of God and Son of man,
   Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
   Now and forevermore be Thine.
