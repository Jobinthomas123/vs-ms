Chorus:
    |2|          |2|ma7            |2|7
   Surely the presence of the Lord
                 |7|
    is in this place;
         |4|m               |9|
   I can feel His mighty power
              |2|   |4|m7
    and His grace.
          |2|
   I can hear the brush
         |2|ma7
    of angels’ wings;
           |2|7           |7|
   I see glory on each face.
    |4|m          |9|              |7|
   Surely the presence of the Lord
       |9|         |2|
    is in this place.

           |2|             |11|m
1. In the midst of His children,
        |7|                 |9|
   The Lord said He would be.
               |2|         |11|m
   It doesn’t take very many;
          |7|                |9|
   It can be just two or three,
          |6|
   And I feel that same
             |11|m
    sweet Spirit
              |9|                |2|
   That I’ve felt oft times before;
    |4|7           |4|
   Surely I can say —
        |4|m             |9|
   I’ve been with the Lord.

2. There’s a holy hush around us,
   As God’s glory fills this place.
   I’ve touched the hem
    of His garment;
   I can almost see His face!
   And, my heart is overflowing
   With the fullness of His joy.
   I know without a doubt
   That I have been with the Lord.
