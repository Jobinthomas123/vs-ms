Lord, send some more Elijahs
     |0|             |7|
 to pray the fire downâ€”

To send the fire
     |4|m             |9|m-|2|
 and also send the rain,
    |7|                 |7|7
To heal the sick and raise the dead,
      |0|          |7|
And glorify Thy name;

Hallelujah!
       |9|m     |2|     |7|
Send revival once again.
