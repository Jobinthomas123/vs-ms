1. Open your eyes
           |4|m7
    to the world all around you.
   |7|              – |2|/|6| –
   Open your eyes,
    |9|
    open your eyes.
         |2|
   This world is much more than
          |4|m7
    the things that surround you;
    |7|
   You must arise,
        |2|/|6|-|9|
    and now open your eyes.
        |7|
   Sometimes we’re too busy
         |2| — |9|
    to share,
        |7|                 |9|4 - |9|
   But Jesus wants us to care.

Chorus:
    |2|                  |9|/|1|
   Jesus says when we touch
                     |11|m
    someone in His name,
                   |7|
   We’re touching Him.
    |2|                  |9|/|1|
   Jesus says when we feed
                     |11|m
    someone in His name,
                  |7|
   We’re feeding Him.
    |2|                  |9|/|1|
   Jesus says when we love
                     |11|m
    someone in His name,
                 |7|
   We’re loving Him.
        |7|
   So, we need to show them
         |2|/|6|
    the light,
       |7|
   And we must pour out
         |9|4 - |9|
    our lives.

2. Open your arms
    to the naked and shiv’ring.
   Open your arms, open your arms.
   A little less taking,
    a whole lot more giving;
   So safe and warm,
    we can open our arms.
   And, love just a little bit stronger,
   And pray a little bit longer.

3. Open your hearts
    to the ones who are desp’rate.
   Open your hearts,
    open your hearts.
   They’ll never repay you,
    but their souls are worth it;
   Life you’ll impart
    when you open your heart.
   And, Jesus loves all men the same,
   We must go out in His name.

Ending: (Sung after chorus)
    |2|                  |9|/|1|
   Jesus says when we love
                     |11|m
    someone in His name,
                  |7| —- |9|
   We’re loving Him;
                 |2|
   We’re loving Him.
