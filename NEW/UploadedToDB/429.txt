Chorus:
   |2|               |7|
   I will sing to You, O Lord,
         |2|           —|7|
    with all my heart;
   |2|                 |11|m
   I will climb the mountain
           |4|m — |9|
    of my God.
   |2|                 |7|
   I will seek Your face now,
      |2|
    praying ev’ry day
                   |9|
   Till I see Your coming,
            |2|  —|2|7
    O dear Lord.

                |7|
1. Now on that day He will
     |9|             |6|m7  —|11|m7
    rapture us to heaven,
                  |4|m
   And we’ll be changed in the
     |9|               |2|  – |2|7
    likeness of His Son.
                 |7|
   And, all our battles
          |9|            |6|m7 — |11|m7
    and trials will be over;
               |4|
   We shall depart to live forever
              |9| – |9|7
    with the Lord.

2. When Jesus comes
    for His saints in all His glory,
   Then He will reap all the labor
    of His love.
   And, He will take for Himself
    His perfect bride—
   The faithful church
    that He redeemed
   With His own blood.
