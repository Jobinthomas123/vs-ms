1. Once my life was so empty;
      |7|/|11|              |9|m7
   I had no reason to live.
   |7|               |9|m7
   I couldn’t find anyone
          |7|/|11|           |9|m7
    with real love to give;
  |7|                    |9|m7
   Then one day I met Jesus—
 |7|/|11|              |9|m7
   Hallelujah my Jesus!
  |7|              |9|m7
   Such a love divine into my
     |7|/|11|         |10|dim
    broken life came;
    |0|          |2|
   Since that day I’m just not
         |7|—-|9|m7-|7|/|11|- |10|dim
    the same!
  |0|        |2|
   Since I met Him I’m not
         |0| — |7|
    the same!

Chorus:
  |7|                    |0|/|7|
   I want to tell the world
      |7|  |2|/|6|   |7|
    what I’ve found!

   I’ve got to spread
         |0|/|7|  |7|  |2|/|6| |7|
    the Good News around!
          |2|      |0|
   Oh, I cannot hide the joy
              |2|
    that’s inside,
                 |4|m
   ‘Cause Jesus died and now
          |0|
    He’s alive.
                       |7|
   Oh, Hallelujah He lives!
           |2|       |0|
   Once I was so blind,
                   |2|
    but now I can see!
              |4|m
   Oh, I was bound, but He made
         |0|
    me free;
                      |7|
   Oh, Hallelujah He lives!

2. Once I wandered in darkness;
   I didn’t know where to go.
   Felt like I was sinking
    ‘til I’d lost ev’ry hope.
   Jesus came to my rescue,
   Heard Him tell me, “I love you”.
   With a voice so tender I heard
    Him calling my name;
   Since that day I’m just not
    the same!
   Since I met Him I’m not the same!

3. Now my life is so different;
    I’m happy all of the time.
   Soon Jesus will come again
    in the flash of an eye.
   Oh, my Jesus is coming,
   Hallelujah! He’s coming—
   Catching me up to His throne,
    with Him there to reign.
   In that moment I will be changed!
   And, I will never be the same!

   (End on third verse)
