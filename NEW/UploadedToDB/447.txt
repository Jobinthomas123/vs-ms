      |2|              |9|/|1|
1. I make my life a prayer to You;
      |11|m
   I want to do what
         |11|m/|9|
    You want me to—
       |7|
   No empty words and
     |9|
    no white lies,
       |7|
   No token prayers,
        |9|
    no compromise.
      |2|              |9|/|1|
   I wanna shine the light You gave
      |11|m
   Through Your Son
         |11|m/|9|
    You sent to save us
     |7|                |9|
   From ourselves and our despair;
       |7|               |9|
   It comforts me to know
                    |2|
    You’re really there.

Chorus:
      |2|                |9|/|1|
   I wanna thank You, Lord,
               |11|m          |11|m/|9|
    for being patient with me.
       |7|                |2|/|6|
   Oh, it’s so hard to see
             |4|m7        |9|
    when my eyes are on me!
      |2|                  |9|/|1|
   I guess I’ll have to trust
                |11|m             |11|m/|9|
   And just believe what You say;
               |7|       |2|/|6|
   Oh, You’re coming again,
               |4|m7      |9|
    coming to take me away!

2. I wanna die and let You give
   Your life to me so that
    I might live,
   And share the hope You
    gave to me—
   The love of Christ that set me free.
   I wanna tell the world out there
   You’re not some fable or fairy tale
   That I made up inside my head.
   You’re God the Son;
   You’re risen from the dead.
