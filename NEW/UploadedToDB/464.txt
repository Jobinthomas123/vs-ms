1. When I saw
                   |9|7
    the cleansing fountain
                         |2|
   Open wide for all my sin,
       |2|7                 |7|   —|4|m
   I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing,
     |2|                   |2|/|9|
   When He said,  “Wilt thou
     |9|  |2|
    be clean?”

Chorus:
   |2|
   I will praise Him!

   I will praise Him!

   Praise the Lamb
                  |9|7
    for sinners slain;
     |2|
   Give Him glory, all ye people,
                           |2|/|9|
   For His blood can wash away
     |9|     |2|
    each stain.

2. Tho’ the way seems straight
    and narrow,
   All I claimed was swept away;
   My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
   At my feet in ashes lay.

3. Then God’s fire upon the altar
   Of my heart was set aflame;
   I shall never cease to praise Him,
   Glory, glory to His name!

4. Blessed be the name of Jesus!
   I’m so glad He took me in.
   He’s forgiven my transgressions;
   He has cleansed my heart
    from sin.

5. Glory, glory to the Father!
   Glory, glory to the Son!
   Glory, glory to the Spirit!
   Glory to the Three-in-One!
