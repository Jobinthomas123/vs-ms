Chorus
    |4|         |6|m
   Come unto Jesus,
 |11|7               |9|      |4|
   Give Him your life today;
              |6|m
   Come unto Jesus,
|11|7          |9|    |11|7  |4|
   Let Him have His way.


1. Oh, I know
               |6|m
    there are things in your life
|11|7               |9|       |4|
   You think He can’t forgive;
                   |6|m
   But He will forgive, my friend,
|11|7                       |4|
   He’ll show you how to live.

2. Don’t delay,
    oh, my friend, please obey.
   You can’t afford to wait;
   Today is the day for you,
   Soon it could be too late!
