Without Him I could do nothing;
                        |2|
Without Him I’d surely fail.
    |2|7                  |7|
Without Him I would be drifting
           |2|      |9|7     |2|
  like a ship without a sail.

|9|7 |2|      |7| |2|
O Jesus, my Jesus,
        |9|7
Do you know Him today?
              |2|         |2|7
Please don’t turn Him away.
   |7|         |2| |11|m
O Jesus, my Jesus,
    |2|
Without Him
      |9|7            |2|
  how lost I would be.

With Jesus I can do all things;
With Jesus I’d never fail.
With Jesus my ship is anchored,
Safe and sure within the veil.
