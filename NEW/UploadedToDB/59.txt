1. Oh, sing unto the Lord
        |4|m      -|9|
     a new song,
        |2|
   For He hath done
      |11|m         |4|m-|9|
     marvelous things.
    |2|         |2|7
   His right hand
              |7|   |4|m
     and His holy arm
         |2|                 |9|-|2|
   Hath gotten Him the victory.

2. The Lord hath made known
     His salvation;
   His righteousness
     hath He openly showed
   In the sight of the heathen.
   Oh, sing unto the Lord
     a new song.

3. He hath remembered His mercy
     and His truth
   Toward the house of Israel;
   All the ends of the earth have seen
   The salvation of our God.
