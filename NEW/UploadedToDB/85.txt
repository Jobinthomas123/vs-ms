If My people who are called
         |0|
 by My name
      |5|          |0|
Will humble themselves
       |2|m-|7|
 and pray,
    |5|        |4|m
And seek My face,
     |2|m                 |7|7  |0|
And turn from their wicked ways;
                       |4|m
Then will I hear from heaven,
               |5|
Forgive their sin,
                |2|m7
And heal their land.

If My people will
  |2|m7              |7|     |0|
 humble themselves and pray.
