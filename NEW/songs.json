Yes, He cleansed my life so filthy\n   With His holy spotless blood,\n   And He clothed me with His\n    robe of righteousness.\n   What a joy to walk with Him\n    and live by His pure Word\n   And to share His grace\n    and holiness!\n\n4. Do you know that I am baptized\u2014\n   Buried in the water deep?\n   Thus, I\u2019m dead to sin\n    and all its nature wild.\n   Quickened by the Holy Spirit,\n    Who doth now me keep;\n   Oh, how sweet is He\u2014\n    tender and mild!\n\n5. Far above the highest heaven,\n   Crowned with glory\n    He doth reign.\n   In His name shall both\n    the great and small adore.\n   He has conquered every foe,\n    for He died not in vain;\n   And He shall endure forevermore.\n\n6. And He whispers, \u201cI am coming\n   For My bride; yes, she is Mine.\u201d\n   Are you saved, are you baptized\n    and cleansed from sin?\n   Are you filled and are you led\n    by His Spirit Divine?\n   Can you say, \u201cOh my God,\n    I am Thine?\u201d\n",
