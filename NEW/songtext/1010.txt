G
1. Filled with guilt one day
C  DG
I came to His temple;
G
Like the publican
 AAm7-D
I bowed my head in shame.
G   C
I was standing far away
Bm  Em7
When I heard the Savior say,
 Am
“You’re forgiven,
   Dsus4  DG
My child, you’re Mine!”

Chorus:
   Am
Praise God!
 B7   Em
He’s the Lover of my soul.
 D C C/D
Praise God! He has cleansed
G
and made me whole.
   GC
By His blood I am forgiven,
Bm   Em7
Now I’m on my way to heaven,
Am7  C/D
Now my soul shall ever sing,
  D G
“Praise God!”

2.Ever since I met my Lord
and Redeemer,
Ever since He broke the chains
that bound my soul,
He is with me every day,
Walking with me all the way—
Joy excelling has filled my soul!

3.Now I live each day on earth
just to please Him;
Worldly dreams that stained
my mind have fled away.
Love amazing now ablaze,
Singing songs of joy and praise,
Willingly I will follow Him.

4.How my heart is thrilled
to know He is coming;
Very soon one day
I’ll see His glorious face.
I will leave this world of woe,
Sin and death shall be no more,
Blessed Jesus, my Lord,
You’re mine!
