Mold us and make us,
shape us Your way.
Fill and revive, Lord,
change us we pray;
Help us stand firm in the faith.

You lead the way.
Strengthen our soul
to fight night and day!
Cast out our foes,
and free us today;
Vict’ry is ours in Your name.

4.You are our Comfort;
You give us grace
When faced with trials,
sorrow and pain.
We’re filled with hope
as we watch and wait;
Soon You will catch us away.

5. You are the Bridegroom;
We wait for You—
Your love transforming,
making us new.
Jesus, we’ll serve You
in gratitude;
Your shining city in view.
