G                 D
  Love Him in the morning
            A7
  When you see
             D
   the sun arising.
G                 D
  Love Him in the evening
            A7
  Cause He kept you
                D
   through the day;
G                   D
  And in the in-between times
            A7
  When you feel
                   D
   the pressureâ€™s rising,
G                   D
  Remember that He loves you,
           A7           D
   and He promises to stay!
