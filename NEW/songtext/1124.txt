   G         D             A
1. In this place, I have come
                  G
   Searching for You, Lord,
                 Em       A
   Needing Your hand to lead.
           G      D               A
   And to fix my eyes, upon the cross;
                      G
   For my hope is in You and
              Em       A
   All You’ve done for me.

Pre-Chorus:
  G/B     A/C#      Bm      F#m
   I will seek Your face, O God,
          G/B    A/C#       Em
   As I’m waiting for Your touch.

Chorus:
         D
   I am here,
       G              F#m-Bm
   To worship You, my Savior;
        Em
   I am here,
       A                G/B-A/C#
   To give You all my praise.
         D
   I am here,
    G              F#m       - Bm
   Needing more of You, Lord;
        Em      A               G
   I am here, meet me in this place.

2. You said seek and I will find;
   Fill me with Your pow’r
   And Your constant strength,
   That will lift my heart,
   When it’s too weak.
   Lord, stand beside me,
   For it’s You I need.
