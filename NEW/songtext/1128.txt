      D            Bm7
1. O soul, are you weary
         Em7-A7
    and troubled?
       Em7         G/A         Dmaj7
   No light in the darkness you see?
             D          B
   There's light for a look
           Em7-A7
    at the Savior,
      Dmaj7        A       E7   A-A7
   And life more abundant and free.

Chorus:
     D        A        Bm-Am7
   Turn your eyes upon Jesus;
    D7   G          Em         A7
   Look full in His wonderful face,
              D      A/C#
   And the things of earth
               Bm   D7  G
   Will grow strangely dim,
          D/A            A7        G-D
   In the light of His glory and grace.

2. Through death
    into life everlasting
   He passed,
   And we follow Him there;
   Oâ€™er us sin no more hath dominion,
   For more than conquerors we are.

3. His word shall not fail you,
   He promised;
   Believe Him and all will be well.
   Then go to a world that is dying;
   His perfect salvation to tell.
