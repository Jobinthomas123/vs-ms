1. Every high mountain
         G/B
   That stands in my way
    F/A
   Serves to remind me
        Am          G
   That my God is great.
    C
   And when strong giants
    G/B
   Laugh in my face,
     F/A
   Again I’m reminded that
   Gsus4       G
   My God is great.

Chorus:
              C
   And He’s greater,
           G/B
   So the mountains move;
           Am
   He is greater,
          F       G
   So the giants fall.
                Am
    And there’s no such
                F–Am
    Thing as impossible
           F
   For my God,
           G
   Who’s greater
              F (going to bridge: C)
    Than them all.


2. Sounds of the battle
   I hear every day;
   In them are whispers
   That my God is great.
   And when it feels like
   My world starts to shake,
   I’ll just remember that
   My God is great.

3. What is the mountain
   You’re facing today?
   Look up to Jesus;
   Remember He’s great.
   And not one giant
   Can stand in His way;
   Jesus will help you
   And you can proclaim that...

Bridge:
G Am
   We will not fear the giants,
G Am
   We will not fear the mountains,
G Am
   We will not fear for God is near,
F
   And He
Gsus4-G
    is greater than them all.
