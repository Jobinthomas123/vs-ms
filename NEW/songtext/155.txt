    A       D/A      A
1. Low in the grave He lay –
     E-E7  D/A   A
    Jesus my Savior!
    D           A
   Waiting the coming day –
     B-E  B7  E
    Jesus my Lord!

Chorus
   A
   Up from the grave He arose,
                  D
   With a mighty triumph
              A
    o’er His foes.
        E7
   He arose a victor
              A
    from the dark domain,
           D       B7
   And He lives forever
              E      E4  E7
    with His saints to reign.
        A         D
   He arose! He arose!
         A            E7-A
   Hallelujah! Christ arose!

2. Vainly they watch His bed –
    Jesus my Savior!
   Vainly they seal the dead –
    Jesus my Lord!

3. Death cannot keep his prey –
    Jesus my Savior!
   He tore the bars away –
    Jesus my Lord!
