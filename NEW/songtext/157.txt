1. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;
    E7                      A
   Sing His mercy and His grace.
           A7     D          Bm7
   In the city, bright and blessed,
    A        E             A
   He’ll prepare for us a place.

Chorus
           A-D/A       A
   When we all get to heaven,
                    B7
   What a day of rejoicing
               E
    that will be!
           A        D  -Bm
   When we all see Jesus,
         A          E             A
   We’ll sing and shout the victory.

2. While we walk the
    pilgrim pathway,
   Clouds will over-spread the sky;
   But when trav’ling days are over,
   Not a shadow, not a sigh.

3. Let us then be true and faithful—
   Trusting, serving ev’ry day.
   Just one glimpse of Him in glory
   Will the toils of life repay.

4. Onward to the prize before us!
   Soon His beauty we’ll behold.
   Soon the pearly gates will open;
   We shall tread the streets of gold!
