1. Now I know Him, my Healer,
        C          G
    my Savior, and my King,
            C            G
   And I’m sure that He watches
         C
    o’er me.
            C             F
   He’s my Buckler, High Tower,
             C         G
    great Jehovah Who healeth;
          C
   Every time His grace
      G      C-C7
    shelters me.

Chorus:
     F          C
   Christ is my way, my goal;
          F         C     G
   I’ve chosen Him as my all.
           C           F
   What a joy it’s to serve Him,
       C             G
   To love Him, to please Him;
           C      F
   I’m a child, child,
      G7          C
    child of His love!

2. And, I love Him, my Father,
    my Brother and Leader,
   And I’m sure that He careth
    for me.
   He’s my Shepherd Who feedeth,
    and Redeemer Who knoweth;
   Every step His eye guideth me.

3. And, to please Him, my Lover,
    my Friend and Companion,
   And how true that He speaketh
    to me.
   Yes, my pathway shines brighter,
    when eternal my outlook;
   Every hour His love keepeth me.

4. And, I fear Him, my Master,
    Instructor Almighty,
   For I’m certain His judgments
    are true.
   Now the saints through all ages
    saw a kingdom for righteous,
   Every one will fear ELOHIM.

5. How it thrills me, great service
    my offer to my God,
   For I count it a priv’lege to serve.
   There on Zion the mountain,
   All His servants who followed;
   Everyone He names as His own.
