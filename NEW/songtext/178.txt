        D            A         D
1. Just as I am, without one plea,
         A        A7
   But that Thy blood
          G       D
    was shed for me,
                  D7
   And that Thou bidd’st me
     G       Em7
    come to Thee,
      D             A
   O Lamb of God, I come!
    A7 D
    I come!

2. Just as I am, and waiting not,
   To rid my soul of one dark blot,
   To Thee Whose blood
    can cleanse each spot,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

3. Just as I am, tho’ tossed about
   With many a conflict,
    many a doubt,
   Fightings and fears
   Within, without,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

4. Just as I am, poor,
    wretched, blind;
   Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
   Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

5. Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
   Wilt welcome, pardon,
    cleanse, relieve.
   Because Thy promise I believe,
   O Lamb of God, I come! I come!
