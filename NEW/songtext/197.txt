1. Sweet hour of prayer,
           F        Dm
    sweet hour of prayer,
         C               G
   That calls me from a world
         G7
    of care,
        C      C7
   And bids me at
        F          Dm
    my Father’s throne,
        C
   Make all my wants
         G7      C
    and wishes known.
       C – G  C   F - C
   In seasons of distress and grief,
            G  C–F    C      G
   My soul has often found relief,
       C      C7
   And oft escaped
         F          Dm
    the tempter’s snare
        C   Am
   By thy return,
           G        C
    sweet hour of prayer.

2. Sweet hour of prayer,
    sweet hour of prayer,
   Thy wings shall my petition bear
   To Him whose truth
    and faithfulness
   Engage the waiting soul to bless.
   And, since He bids me
    seek His face,
   Believe His Word and
    trust His grace,
   I’ll cast on Him my ev’ry care,
   And wait for thee,
    sweet hour of prayer.

3. Sweet hour of prayer,
    sweet hour of prayer,
   May I thy consolation share,
   Till from Mount Pisgah’s
    lofty height,
   I view my home,
    and take my flight.
   This robe of flesh I’ll drop and rise
   To seize the everlasting prize;
   And shout, while passing
    thro’ the air,
   Farewell, farewell,
    sweet hour of prayer!
