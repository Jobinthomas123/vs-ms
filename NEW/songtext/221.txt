1. Would you be free
              C         G
    from the burden of sin?
            D             D7
   There’s power in the blood,
      G
    power in the blood.
                          C       G
   Would you o’er evil a victory win?
            D         D7
   There’s wonderful power
              G
    in the blood.

Chorus:
             G
   There is power, power,
    C              G
   Wonder-working power
           Am–D7        G
   In the blood of the Lamb.

   There is power, power,
    C              G
   Wonder-working power
            Am       D7
   In the precious blood
            G
    of the Lamb.

2. Would you be free
    from your passion and pride?
   There’s power in the blood,
    power in the blood.
   Come for a cleansing
    to Calvary’s tide;
   There’s wonderful power
    in the blood.

3. Would you be whiter,
    much whiter than snow?
   There’s power in the blood,
    power in the blood.
   Sin stains are lost
    in its life-giving flow;
   There’s wonderful power
    in the blood.

4. Would you do service
    for Jesus your King?
   There’s power in the blood,
    power in the blood.
   Would you live daily
    His praises to sing?
   There’s wonderful power
    in the blood.
