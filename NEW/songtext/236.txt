1. How I praise Thee,
      C       G
    precious Savior,
             D                D7
   That Thy love laid hold of me.
              G          C
   Thou hast sav’d and cleansed
         G
    and filled me,
           D          D7    G
   That I might Thy channel be.

Chorus:
            D              G
   Channels only, blessed Master,
            C
   But with all
         Am7      G
    Thy wondrous power.
             D
   Flowing thro’ us,
               G
   Thou canst use us
          C       D     G
   Every day and every hour.

2. Just a channel, full of blessing
   To the thirsty hearts around,
   To tell out Thy full salvation,
   All Thy loving message sound.

3. Emptied that Thou shouldest
    fill me,
   A clean vessel in Thy hand.
   With no power but as Thou givest
   Graciously with each command.

4. Witnessing Thy power to save me,
   Setting free from self and sin.
   Thou hast bought me
    to possess me;
   In Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

5. Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit,
   Hearts that full surrender know
   That the streams of Living Water,
   From our inner man may flow.
