By the anointing
   |9|*7*               |2|
  Jesus breaks the yoke,

By the Holy Ghost and power
  |4|*7*                     |9|
  just as the prophets spoke.
  |2|
These are the days
          |7|
  of the Latter Rain,
 |9|*7*               |2|
God is moving in power again,
          |7|
And the anointing
         |2|   |9|*7*   |2|
  will break the yoke.
