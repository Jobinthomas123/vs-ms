You can’t stop me
      |5|         |0|
From loving my Lord;
               |9|*m*
No power can change
    |2|*7*           |7|*7*
My faith in His Word.
            |0|
Though you take all my gain,
         |5|            |0|
I’ll not fret nor complain;
                   |9|*m*
No, you can’t stop me
      |7|         |0|
From loving my Lord.
