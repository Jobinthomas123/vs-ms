            D
1. When we reach
              D7
    the Holy Mountain
      G                D
   Beyond the crystal sea,
                                Bm7
   Then we’ll sing the songs of Zion;
       E7                  A
   Of highest themes they be.
             D            D7
   There we see the holy Father—
       G           D
   Unseen by other men.
                     G        D—Bm7
   The unsearchable riches in Zion
        Em     A  D
   Are within our ken.

Chorus:
      D          D7
   I long to be ready
       G                D
   To meet Him when He comes;
                   Bm
   I long for the Rapture,
      E7               A
   To meet Him in the air.
                           D7
   Oh, I want to see the glory
        G                  D
   And hear Him say, “Well done”;
                    G
   For I long to be ready
      D      Bm7    Em  A  D
   To meet Him when He appears.

2. I may have no earthly treasures,
   No certain dwelling place;
   I’ll not pine for worldly pleasures,
   For I am saved by grace.
   Now I’ll rather walk with Jesus
   And with Him stand alone,
   For I long to be ready
    to meet Him
   At His holy throne.

3. Now I know my Savior truly;
   I chose the narrow way.
   It will lead to Zion surely
   At breaking of the day.
   And, I’ll never grumble ever—
   In trials firmly stand.
   Where He leads,
   I will follow Him gladly
   With His chosen band.

4. He will own them ‘fore the Father
   And name them one by one.
   There on Zion with the Savior,
   This great prize have they won.
   And, from Zion they’ll be reigning
    for all eternity.
   They are found to be faithful
    and worthy
   By the Trinity.

5. Oh, how perfect is Mount Zion;
   God truly loveth thee.
   Thou wast true to heavenly vision,
   For truth had made thee free.
   When the Lord shall
    build up Zion,
   Then Jesus shall appear.
   It is time to be ready to meet Him;
   Watch, the hour is near.
