D
He is the Rock,

And His work is perfect;
G                 D
All His ways are judgment.
   G
A God of truth
        D       Bm
And without iniquity,
Em       A        D
Just and right is He.
D        A        D
Just and right is He (Hallelujah!),
G                 D
Just and right is He.
   G
A God of truth
        D       Bm
And without iniquity,
Em        A       D
Just and right is He.
