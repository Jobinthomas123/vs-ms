           |D|
They that wait upon the Lord

  shall renew their strength;
            |A|
They shall mount up
        |A|*7*      |D| *-* |D|*7*
  with wings as eagles.
            |G|
They shall run
              |E|*m*
  and not be weary;
            |D|           |B|*m*
They shall walk and not faint.
           |D|
Teach me, Lord,
           |E|*m7*  |A|   |D|
Teach me, Lord, to wait.
