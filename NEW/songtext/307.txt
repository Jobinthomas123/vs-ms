          E
When I’m down,
          E7
When I’m down and out,
         A
When my heart
             F#       B
 is full of fear and doubt,
        E          A
Then I lift up my hands,
      E             A
And He lifts up my heart,
         E
And my troubles
       B        E
 just all roll away!

          A
Roll ‘em away, Lord,
           E
 roll ‘em away! x2

                   A
When I lift up my hands,
       E             A
Then He lifts up my heart,
        E
And my troubles
      B         E
 just all roll away!

      A               B
Well, I can’t see the sun
         E            C#m
 with my head to the ground.
A             E
Tears dim my vision
     F#7             B
 and weigh my heart down,
    E         A
But I found a secret
     E           A
 when I kneel to pray.
     E           A
If I lift up my hands,
        E            A
 then He lifts up my heart,
        E
And my troubles
      B        E
 just all roll away.
