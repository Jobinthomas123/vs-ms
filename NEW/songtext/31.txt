                 |G|
Therefore the redeemed

  of the Lord shall return,
               |C|
And come with singing
        |A|*m7*
  unto Zion,
         |G|
And everlasting joy
         |D|*7*             |G|
  shall be upon their heads.

              |C|
They shall obtain
                |G|
  gladness and joy,
     |A|*7*
And sorrow and mourning
              |D|
  shall flee away.
