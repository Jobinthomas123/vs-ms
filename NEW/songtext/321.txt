       |G|
Lord, send some more Elijahs
     |C|             |G|
 to pray the fire downâ€”

To send the fire
     |E|*m*             |A|*m-*|D|
 and also send the rain,
    |G|                 |G|*7*
To heal the sick and raise the dead,
      |C|          |G|
And glorify Thy name;

Hallelujah!
       |A|*m*     |D|     |G|
Send revival once again.
