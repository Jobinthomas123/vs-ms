          |G|           |G|*7*
Put your hand to the plow;
 |C|                  |A|*m7*
Don’t you look back now.
   |D|
Remember Lot’s wife,
                        |G|
And take heed for your life.
                        |G|*7*
You’re the salt of the earth,
       |C|            |A|*m7*
Not a pillar of no worth;
    |D|                    |G|
So put your hand to the plow.

          |G|          |G|*7*
See that field over there—
      |C|               |A|*m7*
Just waiting for the plow.
     |D|
The laborers are few,
            |C|              |G|
That’s why God has chosen you.
                              |G|*7*
Let’s work quick before it’s night;
     |C|                  |A|*m7*
The harvest fields are white,
    |D|                    |G|
So put your hand to the plow.
