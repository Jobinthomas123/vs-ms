       |G|                       |C|
*1.* On Calv’ry’s tree, pierced hands,
                   |G|
    and feet, and side,
          |C|       |A|*m*        |D|
   Thou diedst in love for me;
        |G|
   And now, O Lord,
       |C|              |G|
    I must, I must decide—
         |C|    |D|        |G|
   Shall I belong to Thee?

*Chorus:*
      |D|       |G|       |C|
   I will! I will! I will,
        |G|
   God helping me!
              |E|*m*       |A|*m —* |D|
   I will, O Lord, be Thine!
        |G|                   |C|
   Thy precious blood was shed
                 |G|
    to purchase me;
      |C|       |D|       |G|
   I will be wholly Thine.

*2.* By grace I will Thy mercy
    now receive;
   Thy love hath my heart won.
   On Thee, O Christ, I will,
    I will believe
   And trust in Thee alone.

*3.* Thou knowest, Lord,
    that I am very weak,
   And how I fear to stray.
   But, grace and pow’r
    from Thee alone I seek;
   I’ll overcome each day.

*4.* I hear Thy voice
    to come and follow Thee;
   A choice now I must make
   Between this world and
    Thy great love for me.
   This world I will forsake!

*5.* My heart doth thrill
    to think Thy coming’s near;
   I’ll see Thee face to face.
   In Thine own image
    I shall soon appear—
   Transformed by sovereign grace!
