    |C|          |A|*m*   |F|
*1.* Was it for nought that I died
        |G|
    on Calvary?
       |C|            |A|*m*
   My love gave I thee
        |D|*m7*           |G|
    to transform thy life;
   |C|         |A|*m*           |F|
   I have a purpose for thee.
              |G|             |C| *—* |C|*7*
    Wilt thou yield now to Me?

*Chorus:*
 |F|               |G|
   However shall I say “No”
        |C|*ma7*        |A|*m*
    to such a great love?
 |F|                   |G|
   A love that constraineth me
       |C|*ma7*       |A|*m*
    to say, “Yes, Lord!”
 |F|               |G|
   O Lord, I surrender
             |C|*ma7*       |A|*m*
    my whole life unto Thee;
 |D|*m7*              |G|                |C|
   A prisoner of love shall I ever be.

*2.* In times of myrrh,
    a comfort I’ll be to thee.
   Both sweet times and trials
    will sanctify thee;
   I’ll be with thee through it all.
    Wilt thou answer My call?

*3.* Though times be dark, soon joy
    will break forth as light.
   I’ll gather thee home
    to reign as My bride.
   Come sit with Me on My throne.
   Wilt thou now be Mine own?
