 |E|            |B|*7*
*1.* Direct my heart, O Lord,
    |A|      |A|*m*             |E|
   Into devoted love for You.
               |B|*7*
   Let every thought of mine
         |A|
    be stayed on You—
      |A|*m*                 |E|
   A love steadfast and true.

*Chorus:*
 |A|                 |B|*7*
   For, You’re my God and King,
 |F#|*m*         |B|*7*
   Master of everything,
 |F#|*m*                 |B|*7*
   And unto You, my Lord,
              |E|
    do I now sing.
 |A|                |B|*7*
   Yes, You’re my God and King,
 |F#|*m*         |B|*7*
   Master of everything,
 |F#|*m*                |B|*7*
   And unto You my life
              |E|
    do I now bring.

*2.* O Lord, take every idol
    from my heart;
   I’ll not from You depart.
   Your love on Calvary
    constrains me to
   Draw closer unto You.

*3.* I want to serve You now,
    Lord, faithfully,
   I’ll by Your mercies be
   A vessel just for You.
    I’ll be Your own
   My heart shall be Your throne.

*4.* I lift my soul, O Father,
    unto You;
   Your mercies they are new.
   I want to walk with You,
    so take my hand;
   I’ll be at Your command.

*5.* Tie me with bands of love;
    they will suffice.
   I’ll be Your sacrifice,
   For on Your altar,
    My High Priest and King,
   I surrender everything.
