2.Oh! to be like Thee—
full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving,
tender and kind,
Helping the helpless,
Cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandering sinner
to find.

3.Oh, to be like Thee—
lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless,
patient and brave,
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, others to save.

4.Oh, to be like Thee,
Lord, I am coming
Now to receive
the anointing divine.
All that I am and have
I am bringing;
Lord, from this moment
all shall be Thine.

5. Oh, to be like Thee,
while I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit,
fill with Thy love.
Make me a temple
meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit me for life and heaven above.
