  |G|              *-*|C|
Spring up, O well,
             |G|
  within my soul.

Spring up, O well,
            |D|*7*
  and overflow.
              |G|  *-*|C|
Spring up, O well,
                  |G|
Flow out through me.
                  *-*|D|*7*
Spring up, O well,
             |G|
Set others free.

  |G|
There’s a River of Life
        |C|            |G|
Flowing out through me.

It makes the lame to walk
         |A|*7*      |D|*7*
And the blind to see.
|G|
Opens prison doors,
          |C|         |G|
Sets the captives free;

There’s a River of Life
               |D|*7*   |G|
Flowing out through me.
