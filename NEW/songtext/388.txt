GC/G
1.I’m not ashamed of the Gospel;
 G
it’s the power of God.
EmD
Jesus, He died and was buried,
  C
And He’s risen
G  -Am7-D
from the dead.
G
Our sickness healed,
   C/G
The bondage of sin
 G
has been removed;
Em G
Lamb of God, His blood
 D
brings liberty!

Chorus:
Am7 Bm/A
Now Christ is risen,
Am7D
alive forevermore.
Am7 Bm/A   Am7
His tomb is empty ‘cause death
   C
had no power to hold Him;
   D G
He is the Lord.

2.Old life of sin has been buried
in the waters of Jordan;
Planted with Him, together
in the likeness of His death;
Raised from the grave to walk
in the newness of His life;
Old things past,
behold all things made new.

3.The fire of God it came down
on the day of Pentecost;
Filled with a pow’r
That would turn the whole world
upside down;
“Go heal the sick, cast out devils,
even raise up the dead;
Tell the world, My kingdom
now has come.”

4.We shall be changed in a moment,
Yes, the twinkle of an eye;
Sin and death they are
swallowed by His victory.
When Jesus comes, we know
we shall be just like Him—
Face to face, with Him
forevermore.
