 |G|
John saw the multitude

  of the overcomers,

And all of them were
                   |D|*7*
  worshipping the Lord.

Some of them were singing,

Some of them were shouting,

But all of them were
                   |G|
  worshipping the Lord.


Oh, praise the Lord!

Oh, praise the Lord!
 |D|*7*                    |G|
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! *x2*
