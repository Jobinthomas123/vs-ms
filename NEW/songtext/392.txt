   E
1.There’s coming a wonderful,

wonderful day;
A E
It’s glory has never been known.

When free from our burdens,

we’re going away
 A  E   B7 E
As Jesus returns for His own.

Chorus:
E
When Jesus returns for His own
   B7
And carries us up to His throne;
  E
There’ll be no more sadness

But all will be gladness,
   A  E   B7 E
When Jesus returns for His own.

2.Then those who have suffered
and toiled for His name,
Tho’ hated, rejected, unknown,
No longer shall suffer
the world’s scorn and shame,
When Jesus returns for His own.

3.Triumphant they’ll rise
with their Lord in the air
And sit with Him soon
on His throne.
While those who once ridiculed,
weep in despair,
When Jesus returns for His own.

4.No longer we’ll think
of the trial down here,
The days when we suffered alone;
For God’s loving hand
wipes away ev’ry tear,
When Jesus returns for His own.

5.Then let us be faithful
e’en down unto death,
Nor ever our troubles bemoan;
But render Him praise
and rejoice full of faith,
That we may be counted His own.
