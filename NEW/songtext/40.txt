1. I – see the Lord;
   |G|*-*|D|*7*         |G|
   I – see the Lord.
          |D|*7*
   He is high and lifted up
             |G|
   And His train fills the temple.
          |D|*7*
   He is high and lifted up
             |G|
   And His train fills the temple.

   The angels cry, “Holy,”

   The angels cry, “Holy,”

   The angels cry,
         |D|*7*      |G|
   “Holy is the Lord.”

2. hear…
   As His Word issues forth
   It resounds through the temple …

3. love…
   He is high and lifted up
   Yet He dwells with the lowly …
