|C|
All over the world
               |G|*7*
The Spirit is moving.

All over the world

As the prophets said
            |C|
  it would be;

All over the world
                      |F|
Thereâ€™s a mighty revelation
                     |C|
Of the glory of the Lord,
       |G|*7*                |C|
As the waters cover the sea.
