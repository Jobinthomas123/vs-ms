D
1.When I first fell in love with Jesus,

Oh, I gave Him all my heart;

And I thought I just couldn’t love

Him more
 E7  A7
Than I did right at the start.
 D
But, now I look back over
D7
 the mountains
G
And the valleys where I’ve been;

It makes me know that
  D
I love Him so much—
   Em7  A7   D
More than I did then!


Chorus #1:
D
I keep falling in love with Him,

Over and over, and
Em7
over and over again.
A Em  A7
I keep falling in love with Him,
 Em  A7
Over and over, and
   Em A7  D
over and over again.
 D
He gets sweeter and sweeter
   D7
as the days go by,
G
Oh, what a love
 Gm
between my Lord and I!
   D
I keep falling in love with Him,
A7
Over and over, and
GA  D
 over and over again!

2.There’s a hand that I hold on to
Through each valley and
each trial;
There’s a shoulder that I
lean upon
As I face another mile.
And, there’s a love that I can
depend on;
It’s fresh and new each day,
My heart is overflowing with love,
And that is why I say:

Chorus #2:
I keep falling in love with Him,
Deeply in love with Him,
More than my tongue
can proclaim.
I keep falling in love with Him,
Deeply in love with Him,
My life’s no longer the same.
I keep wondering and wondering
the reason why.
How can He love a one such as I?
I keep falling in love with Him,
Over and over, and
over and over again.
