1.In the very thought of Jesus,
   F#m  Bm
His presence can be found;

He’s as close as the mention
F#m –D7   Gma7- G6-Em-A7-D

2.Oh, and in my hour of struggle
So many times I’ve found,
He’s as close as the mention
of His name.
Just to breathe the name of Jesus
Turns everything around;
He’s as close as the mention
of His name.
