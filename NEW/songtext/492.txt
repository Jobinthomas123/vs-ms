1.There’s a city of God
   D
that is made without hands,

For the saints from all nations
A
to share,
   D G
Where the streets are of gold
  D
in that radiant land—
D/A  A  D-D7
Oh, when shall I go o’er there?

Chorus:
 G
Jerusalem fair,
   D
I long to be there;
A
The Lord is now waiting
   A7  D
to welcome me there!
  G
There’s rest from my toil
D   Bm
and life without care;
  D D/AAD
I want to be there sweet home!

2.The foundations are twelve,
what a precious display—
Glory of His bondservants declare.
There the wall is of jasper,
His martyrs portray.
Oh, when shall I go o’er there?

3.There each gate of a pearl
to the ancients compare,
Gushing River of Life
flowing there.
And all manner of fruits
for His wisdom to share.
Oh, when shall I go o’er there?

4.There the thrones of the Lamb
and the Father are found;
From the height of Mount Zion
they reign.
From redemption’s firstfruits
a new song doth resound.
Oh, when shall I go o’er there?
