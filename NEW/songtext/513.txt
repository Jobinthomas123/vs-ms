1.Now with My stripes
 B7
you’re healed,
EA
And by My blood you’re free;
E  B7
And with the grace I give,
A E
You can reign victoriously.

2.Now you can do all things,
If you will just believe;
The devil, he must flee,
When you put your trust in Me.

3.My power I now give
To make you witnesses;
Preach My Word and see
All the souls I will set free!

4.The weak can say, “I’m strong!”
When to Me they belong;
Sufficient is My grace,
So be faithful, run the race.
