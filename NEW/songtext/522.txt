Dm
You come against me

with a spear,
F
a javelin and sword,
A4
But I come against you in the
 ADm
name of my almighty Lord. x2

Gm
Today the Lord will give you
   Dm
into my hand,
  A7
And I will overcome,
 Dm
I’ll surely overcome.
Gm
The battle is the Lord’s;
Dm
He’s fighting for me,
 A7
So all of the earth now may know,
  Dm
there’s a God in Israel.
