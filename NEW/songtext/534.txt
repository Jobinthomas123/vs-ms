1.Before the birth
   D
of the world’s great wonders
E  C#m7  D
And lofty mountains high,
D/GF#m7
O Lord, You were there,
   A/E
The Lord throughout
E   C#m7-D-C#m7-Bm7-E
all of time ... time.

2.You’ve seen the years
pass in untold numbers
As in a single night;
O Lord, make us wise
to live holy lives for You...You.

3.How long, O Lord,
till You end our sorrow
And joy can take its place?
O Lord, satisfy our hope
With Your pow’r and grace...
grace.
