Love, wonderful love,
                   |A|*7*
The love of God to me;

Love, wonderful love,
                       |D|
So rich, so full, so free;
                     |G|
Wide, as wide as the ocean,
 |E|*7*                   |A|
Deep, as deep as the sea,
 |D|
High, as high as the heavens
    |G|
  above,
     |D|   |A|*7* |D|
His love to me.
