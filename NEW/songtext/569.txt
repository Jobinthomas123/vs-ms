Chorus:
   D/A  A D   A/D
Take my life, a living sacrifice,
   G   A   D
Lord, it is the least that I can do.
D/A   A D A/D
Make my life a living sacrifice—
   G   A  D
Holy and acceptable to You.

 D
1.I look upon my life
  Dmaj7
and realize at last
  Em7 A7
That in myself there’s nothing
B4/F#  -  F#
I can do.
   A/GG
And, yet here I stand
  Em7   Bm7
to offer all I am;
 C
I give myself completely,
A
Lord, to You.

2.I cannot be content
until I reach that place
Of total consecration
Lord, to You.
O Lord, break my will;
make my desire Your own.
I long to give my everything
to You.
