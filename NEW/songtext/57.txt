|D|
He paid a debt
            |D|*7*
 He did not owe;
          |G|                |E|*m*
I owed a debt I could not pay.
          |D|          |B|*m*
I needed someone to wash
            |E|*m7-*|A|
  my sins away.
           |D|
And now I sing
              |D|*7*
 a brand new song:
           |G|
“Amazing Grace” –
               |E|*m7*
 the whole day long,
              |D|
‘Cause Jesus paid the debt
      |E|*m7*      |A|*7*    |D|
 that I could never pay.
