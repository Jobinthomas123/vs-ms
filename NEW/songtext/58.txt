    |D|                   |A|*7*
Without Him I could do nothing;
                        |D|
Without Him I’d surely fail.
    |D|*7*                  |G|
Without Him I would be drifting
           |D|      |A|*7*     |D|
  like a ship without a sail.

|A|*7* |D|      |G| |D|
O Jesus, my Jesus,
        |A|*7*
Do you know Him today?
              |D|         |D|*7*
Please don’t turn Him away.
   |G|         |D| |B|*m*
O Jesus, my Jesus,
    |D|
Without Him
      |A|*7*            |D|
  how lost I would be.

With Jesus I can do all things;
With Jesus I’d never fail.
With Jesus my ship is anchored,
Safe and sure within the veil.
