   G   —D/G
You did not wait for me
 C/G
to draw near to You,
 D
But You clothed Yourself with
 D/C G - D/G - C/G
frail humanity;
   G—D/G
You did not wait for me
   C/G
to cry out to You,
   D
But You let me hear
 D/C G
Your voice calling me.

  D—C/D
And I’m forever grateful
   G
to You;
   D—C/D
I’m forever grateful
  G
for the cross.
D —Bm
I’m forever grateful
Em
to You,
  A7Am
That You came to seek
 D  G
and save the lost.
