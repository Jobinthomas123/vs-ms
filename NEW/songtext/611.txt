a new song of praise,
  Am
For His mercy shed on us

as rain.

Great is His wondrous love

shown to human race,

To redeem our soul,
C   GC
cleansing all our sin and stain.

Chorus:
 G  C
Praise His wondrous name;

Praise Him with a grateful heart.

Lift your voice and sing;

Let it through all ages ring.

2.Praise, praise Him for His grace,
grace in time of need,
He’s our Priest Who knows
our nature frail;
In path of trial oft,
oh, His grace did lead.
Took our pains on Him,
and our sickness all did heal.

3.Bless, bless His holy name
for His kindness great,
And His gifts He graciously
loads us with.
He keeps us day by day
by His love and might.
He’s our Hiding Place;
He’s our Rock and Shield
and Strength.

4.Hail, hail Him Lord and King;
soon He shall appear
For His church, His bride,
arrayed in white.
He’ll rule from holy Zion;
saints His kingdom share
From Jerusalem, holy city,
fair and bright.

5.Praise, praise Him night and day,
all ye sons of Zion.
Serve Him in fear and purity,
filled with grace.
His glory we would share
soon there on His throne;
Clothed in garment bright,
praising we shall see His face.
