  DA/E
1.If I rise on the wings of the
   Bm-Bm/A
morning
   G D
And dwell in the uttermost
  Em A
parts of the sea,
 DA/E
Even there Your hand
BmBm/A
leads me onward,
 G
And Your right hand’s
 D   EmA
holding me unto the end.

Chorus:
G   D
I shall not faint
  F#   Bm
nor be dismayed,
   GD
For You help me mount up
EmA4-A
with wings as an eagle.
 G  D
I shall not faint
 F# Bm
nor be dismayed,
GD
For until the end,  Lord,
   AD
I’ll be with You.

2.Precious are Your thoughts
unto me, O God!
How great is the sum of them.
Were I to count them,
How they would outnumber
the grains of sand;
When I shall awake, Lord,
I’m still with You.
