Turn your eyes upon Jesus;
      |G|           |E|*m7*       |A|*-*|A|*7*
Look full in His wonderful face.
          |D|        |D|*7*
And the things of earth
             |G|      |E|*m7*
Will grow strangely dim
|G|*m*      |D|             |E|*m7-*|A|
In the light of His glory
        |D|
  and grace.
