1.Oh, how well I remember

In the old-fashioned days,
 F   C
When some old-fashioned people
  D/F#   G
Had some old-fashioned ways.
 C
In the old-fashioned meetings
F
As they tarried there,
 C Am
In the old-fashioned manner,
 Dm —G C
How God answered  their prayer.

Chorus:
C
‘Twas an old-fashioned meeting

In an old-fashioned place,
Am
Where some old-fashioned people
  D/F#G
Had some old-fashioned grace;
  C
As an old-fashioned sinner
C7F
I began to pray,
C  Am
And God heard me and saved me
 Dm   G   C
In the old-fashioned way.

2.There was singing, such singing
Of those old-fashioned airs!
There was power, such power
In those old-fashioned prayers!
An old-fashioned conviction
Made the sinner pray,
And the Lord heard
and saved him,
In the old-fashioned way.

3.Well, they say it is better,
“Things have changed,
don’t you know,”
And the people in gen’ral,
Seem to think it is so;
And they call me old-fashioned
When I dare to say,
That I like it far better
In the old-fashioned way.

4.If the Lord never changes,
As the fashions of men,
If He’s always the same,
Why, He is old-fashioned then!
As an old-fashioned sinner
Saved through old-time grace,
Oh, I’m sure He will take me
To an old-fashioned place.
