 E
1.The Israelites were held as slaves
B
By Pharoah and his host,

But when they cried unto the Lord,
 B7 E
He hearkened to their voice.
  E
Oh, free at last till the Red Sea,
   B
Where Pharoah, he drew near;

But Moses cried unto the Lord,
  B7E
God spoke into his ear.

He said:

2.God led them to Mt. Sinai;
A mighty host were they.
His glory dwelt within their midst
To guide them all the way.
The Jordan River, deep and wide,
He led them to one day;
“Go step by step, be not afraid,
I’ll lead you all the way.”
He said:

3.At Jericho they stood in awe;
Its walls reached to the sky.
His word was march,
and that they did;
Those walls came tumbling down.
Now many mountains
there may be
Before your path today;
Take heart, O saints!
Go forth in faith!
He’ll lead you all the way.
He says:

Last Chorus:
Go forth!
I’ve given you the victory;
Go forth!
The enemy must flee. x2

Ending:
And we’ll … Go forth!
He’s given us the victory!
Go forth!
The enemy must flee!
