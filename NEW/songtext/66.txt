  Something beautiful,
Em7           A
   Something good,
Em7                    A
  All my confusion
  D        D7
   He understood.
G
  All I had to offer Him
         D              Bm
   was brokenness and strife,
      Em7      D
  And He made something
    A                   D
   beautiful out of my life.
