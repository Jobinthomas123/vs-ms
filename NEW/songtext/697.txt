DF#m/C#
1.Iron has entered my soul,
 Bm   Bm/A
fetters around my feet.
   G Em
Dark, damp, and gloomy pit,
   AA7
this is where I sit.
 D  F#m/C
All alone, all my dreams are gone;
  Cmaj7  DG/B
they seem to fly away.
Gm/Bb   D/A
Hated and despised, and
   Em7
misunderstood,
 A A7DA/C#  Bm  A4  A
Will this be my fate?

2.Deep in my heart I hear
a voice that says, “I’m here,
There is no need to fear,
for I am very near.
I’ve a plan you don’t understand;
these things are from My hand
To mold and shape you, too,
for what I am to do.
Just trust, I’ll see you through.”

3.Most High, take my hand, for
I’m at Your command.
I am Your prisoner,
tested by Your Word.
In this pit I will wait on You;
then my eyes shall see
The dreams You gave to me,
by God’s hand at last
Have all come to pass.
