Nor for fame my pray’r shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Only let me walk with Thee.

3.Lead me thru the vale of shadows;
Bear me o’er life’s fitful sea.
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee—
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
