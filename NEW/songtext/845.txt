Chorus:
  E  A B
My spirit and soul are being filled
E A B
With the pow’r of the Holy Spirit;
E   B/D#   C#m
My life will never be
 E/G# F#m  B
 the same again.
  A  B
There is an anointing
 G#m  C#m
Falling upon me,
 F#m
Changing my life
   B  E
to greater holiness.

   A B
1.Every yoke is broken
 E
by that same anointing
  C#m
coming down;
   F#m   B
Receive it, and be free
  EE7
from deep within.
A B
Enter with thanksgiving;
  EB  C#m
in His courts receive His grace
F#m B
To overcome all sin—
   F#m  B  E
power to be changed.

2.Face to face with Jesus,
I am being changed from glory
Unto glory by the Spirit
of the Lord.
Everyone who has this hope
to see Him as He is
Will purify himself
just as He is pure.

3.What a glorious promise,
that we’ll rule and reign
upon the throne
With Him from Holy
New Jerusalem—
Jesus as the Bridegroom,
with His church
the spotless bride
In shining robes so white—
glorious within.
