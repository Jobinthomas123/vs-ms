 AB E
1.Oh, I see a glorious vision:
A B C#m
Million angels join in one,
   A E/G#
Seeing the Lamb they shout—
A C#m
My own heart cries out—
   F#m   B7  E
This is Jesus, God’s own Son!

Chorus:

  E   G#7   C#m
I will look unto my Savior;
 A E/G#  F#m - B
He will never leave His own.
EG#7   C#m
Yes, my faith is built upon Him;
F#m B7E
He will lead me to the throne.

2.Though He knew
that we’d forsake Him,
Yet love came, arms opened wide.
He endured the cross,
Bore the shame and loss
For the joy of seeing His bride.

3.I will love my precious Savior,
And this love will never die.
Though I see no light
In my endless night
I will never ask Him, “Why?”

4.Now I know it’s not by striving;
Christ in me will reign always.
Laying aside all weight,
Ev’ry sin I’ll hate,
And my soul will shout His praise!

5.Gazing on my true Example;
I will need no more to roam.
Surely by God’s grace
I will see His face
When one day I reach my home.
