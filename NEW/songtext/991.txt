Chorus:
 DGm/DD
Oh righteous, holy God,
   Em - A
We worship You,
  Gm  D
For You’ve redeemed our lives
   F#m7 -- Adim7/B
And made us new.
 Em7 -D
You’ve called us to Your throne;
   D/CG/B
You’ve called us as Your own.
  Em   D/F#
Oh righteous, holy God,
   G  A  Bsus4-B7
We give our lives to You.
 Em
Oh righteous, holy God,
  G  A  D
We give our lives to You.

F#m7  Bm
1.Before the world’s foundation
   Em7
Triune God had made a plan;
  F#m7  Bm
Fallen man would be perfected
   Am   D7
By the blood of Calvary’s Lamb.
   G  F# - F#/A#
While we still hated You—
  Bm   E/G#
Lost and bound by sin,
EmD/F#E/G#
Lord, You gave Your Son to die
AD
Our lives to win.

2.All who call upon the Savior
Are forgiven from their sins.
By repentance comes salvation,
For ye must be born again.
And for sin’s dark nature in us,
The remedy You gave—
For baptism’s waters
Become the old man’s grave.

3.Now Your Holy Spirit fills us
With the power from above
That Your church might be found
holy, blameless in love—
Watching, waiting, looking for
You’re coming back again;
Then we’ll worship You
In New Jerusalem.
