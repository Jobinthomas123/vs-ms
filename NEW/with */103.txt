 |4|                |6|*m—*|11|*7*
How great is our God;
                  |4|*—*|1|*m*
How great is His name.
                  |6|*m—*|11|*7*
How great is His love—
             |4|
Forever the same!
                    |4| *—* |4|*7*
He rolled back the waters
                    |9|*—*|6|*m*
 of the mighty Red Sea,

And He said “I’ll never
  |4|       *—*|11|*7*
 leave you;
                   |4|
Put your trust in Me.”
