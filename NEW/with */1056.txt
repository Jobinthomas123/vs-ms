*1.* Blessed be Your name
          |9|*m7*            |5|
   In the land that is plentiful,
                |0|
   Where Your streams
         |7|
    of abundance flow,
       |5|
   Blessed be Your name.
|0|*-*         |7|
   Blessed be Your name
             |9|*m7*
   When I'm found in the
             |5|
    desert place,
             |0|
   Though I walk through
         |7|
    the wilderness,
       |5|
   Blessed be Your name.

*Pre-Chorus:*
|0|*-*                 |7|
   Ev’ry blessing You
                  *-*|9|*m7*
    pour out, I’ll
                   |5|
   Turn back to praise.
|0|*-*                     |7|
   When the darkness closes
            *-*|9|*m7*
    in, Lord
                 |5|
   Still I will say,

*Chorus:*
                   |0|           |7|
   Blessed be the name of the Lord;
                   |9|*m7-*|5|
   Blessed be Your name.
                   |0|           |7|
   Blessed be the name of the Lord;
                   |9|*m7-*|7|     |5|
   Blessed be Your glorious name.

*2.* Blessed be Your name
   When the sun's shining
    down on me,
   When the world's all
    as it should be,
   Blessed be Your name.
   Blessed be Your name
   On the road marked with
    suffering,
   Though there's pain in the offering,
   Blessed be Your name.

*Bridge:*
        |0|             |7|
   You give and take away,
       |9|*m7*            |5|
   You give and take away,
        |0|                   |7|
   My heart will choose to say,
          |9|*m7*             |5|
   Lord, blessed be Your name!
