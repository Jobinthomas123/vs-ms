*Chorus:*
       |0|
   Be loosed ye bands of wickedness;
       |7|            |0|
   Be undone heavy burdens.

   Oppressed go free;
       |9|*m*        |7|          |0|
   My liberty I give unto thee.

   Oppressed go free;
       |9|*m*        |7|          |0|
   My liberty I give unto thee.

*1.* All authority has been given
         |0|
    unto Me;
          |7|             |7|*7*  |0|
   In My name, demons flee.
                           |7|
   Know I can break your chains;
             |0|*/*|4|          |5|
   In faith call upon My name.
        |9|*m*             |7|
   I’m moving in your midst,
               |0|  *-* |5|*/*|9|
    so be now free.

*2.* I have seen your tears;
   Yes, My child,
    I’ve heard your prayers.
   I am come to deliver thee.
   Afflictions will now cease
   As My power I release.
   I’m moving in your midst,
    so be now free.

*3.* From captivity
   You will serve Me without fear.
   Prison doors, I have opened.
   No one can keep you bound,
   For My favor you have found.
   I’m moving in your midst,
    so be now free.
