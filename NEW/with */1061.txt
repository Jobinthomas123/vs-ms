*Chorus:*

   Fear thou not, for I am with thee;
             |4|*m*           |9|*m*      |2|
   Be not dismayed, for I am thy God.
   |7|        |7|*/*|4|       |0|    |7|*/*|11|
   I will strengthen and uphold thee
   |9|*m*        |2|              |7|

*1.* Moses in the wilderness
  |9|*-*              |2|
   Came unto the burning bush.
 |11|*7-*              |4|*m*         *-*|7|*/*|11|
   From the fire God did say,
  |0|        |2|*7*       |7|
   “I will be with you.”

*2.* Joshua at Jericho
   Did not fear to face the foe.
   Said the Captain of the host,
   “I will go with you.”

*3.* Daniel in the lion’s den
   Cast inside by evil men,
   Yet prevailed God’s promises—
   I will be with you.

*4.* Child, there is no need to fear;
   Guiding you, I’m always near.
   When the future seems unclear,
   I am there with you.

*5.* Yahweh Shammah is My name—
   Precious truth can never change.
   Every moment, every day
   I will be with you.

*6.* Through the fire you may go,
   But you’ll never be alone.
   As the fourth Man said of old,
   “I am here with you.”

*7.* Soon from heaven He will shout,
   Trumpet suddenly will sound.
   In a twinkling we’ll be found
   Ever with the Lord.
