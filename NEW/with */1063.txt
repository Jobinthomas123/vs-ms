*1.* My life is in God’s hand.
         |5|               |0|*/*|4|
   He’s working out His plan,
          |2|*m*
   And I know
        |7|
   I’m never going to
           |0| *-* |5|*/*|9| *-* |7|*/*|11|
   be the same.
      |0|             |4|*m*
   Directing from above
        |5|             |4|*m*
   His needlework of love,
              |2|*m*
   Oh what a mystery,
          |7|                 |0|
   His thoughts concerning me.
               |5|           |0|*/*|4|
   Though the battle rages on
            |2|*m*            |9|*m*
   And the path seems so long,
                     |2|*m   -*|7|
   It is only for a moment
                       |5|*m/*|0| *-* |0|
   Then I’ll be going home.

*Chorus:*
           |5|       |0|*/*|4|
   I will lift my eyes
           |5|       |0|*/*|4|
   To the King of love,
            |7|     |4|   |9|*m*
   To the heights of joy
          |2|        |7|
   New Jerusalem above.
            |5|      |0|*/*|4|
   Oh the crowning day
            |5|*--*|4|*/*|8|*-*|9|*m*
   When we see His  face,
                          |2|*m   -*|7|
   Changed to glory in a moment
                       |5|*m/*|0| *-* |0|
   When finally we’re home.

*2.* Afflicted and in pain
   There’s glory to be gained
   As we wait
   For God to touch us once again.
   There is no need to fear;
   His promises are near.
   They’re bringing hope to us
   When we are in despair.
   As our Father sanctifies,
   There will be no surprise
   When we’re fashioned
    in a moment—
   Made ready for our home.

*3.* The signs around portray
   We’re nearing that great day
   When our Lord
   Will take His waiting bride away.
   And when the trumpet sounds
   The saints will gather round;
   Oh as we bow the knee
   To worship Christ the Lord.
   In the realm of glory bright—
   No more tears, no more night.
   All our trials will be over
   Forever in our home.
