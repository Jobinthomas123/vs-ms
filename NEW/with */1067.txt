*1.* In communion with my Lord
       |0|                |7|
   I bring to Him each care.
         |0|              |7|*/*|11|
   My troubles, all my burdens
       |9|*7*               |2|*7*
   I know that He will bear.
          |7|               |7|*7*
   God’s Word gives me assurance
          |0|               |7|
   That Jesus hears my prayer;
       |0|               |7|*/*|11|
   I find that I am strengthened
   |4|*m*     |9|*m*      |2|*7*       |7|
   As I leave my burdens there.

*Chorus:*
           |4|*m*
   Oh what fellowship
                 |7|
    I have with Jesus!
              |4|*m*        *-*|9|*7*
   A wondrous fellowship–
              |2|
    this my peace.
                 |9|*m    -*|0|
   This sweet communion
          |7|*/*|11|   *-*|4|*m*
    satisfies me;
          |9|*m*       *-*|2|         |7|
   Jesus’ presence is all I need.

*2.* In communion with my Lord
   His presence is so real;
   What joy I have in knowing
   That Jesus is so near.
   For all my doubts and questions
   His answer is my peace.
   I rest in Jesus’ presence,
   For He meets my every need.

*3.* In communion with my Lord
   I’m walking every day.
   It’s Jesus Who is guiding
   Me in this narrow way.
   No enemy can touch me;
   With Jesus I am safe.
   And I will never wander
   If I trust Him and obey.

*4.* In communion with my Lord
   His glory I do see;
   And by the Spirit’s power
   Christ’s image will be seen.
   He whispers, “Cease your striving;
   Surrender now to Me.
   My work will be accomplished
   As you’re seated at My feet.”
