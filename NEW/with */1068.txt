*1.* The church’s one foundation
      |2|*m*      |7|*7*        |0|
   Is Jesus Christ her Lord,
       |0|*/*|4|           |5|
   She is His new creation
      |2|*m*     |0|       |7|
   By water and the Word.

   From heav’n He came
          |5|    |0|*/*|4|
    and sought her
      |9|*m*           |2|*m*
   To be His holy bride;
        |0|*/*|4|
   With His own blood
        |5|*maj7*
    He bought her
       |2|*m*       |7|        |0|
   And for her life He died.

*2.* The church shall never perish!
   Her dear Lord to defend,
   To guide, sustain, and cherish,
   Is with her to the end:
   Though there be those
    who hate her,
   And false sons in her pale,
   Against both foe or traitor
   She ever shall prevail.

*3.* ’Mid toil and tribulation,
   And tumult of her war,
   She waits the consummation
   Of peace forevermore;
   Till, with the vision glorious,
   Her longing eyes are blest,
   And the great church victorious
   Shall be the church at rest.

*4.* O happy ones and holy—
   Lord, give us grace that we
   Like them, the meek and lowly,
   On high may dwell with Thee:
   There, past the border mountains,
   Where in sweet vales the bride
   With Thee by living fountains
   Forever shall abide!
