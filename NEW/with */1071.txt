   He said, “Come,
    |9|          |4|*/*|8|
   Anyone who wants
          |1|*m*
    must deny himself,
     |9|           |11|           |4| *–* |4|*/*|8|
   Take up his cross, follow Me;
       |9|          |1|*m*
   No matter the cost
           |9|         |11|
   Be my heart, my hands,
         |9|
    my voice.”

    |4|          |4|*sus4*        |4|
*1.* How are we living for Christ?
   |4|*/*|8|        |9|           |11|
   How are we living for Christ?
     |1|*m*      |11|           |9|    |4|*/*|8|
   Following Him we will sacrifice
   |6|*m*                    |11|
   But are we willing to die?

*2.* God gives the strength that it takes
   And He knows the price
    that you pay.
   The life you’ve been called to
    will not be in vain;
   So don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid.

*3.* When you are shackled in chains,
   Imprisoned for sharing His name
   If you should suffer
    for righteousness’ sake
   Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid.

*2nd Chorus:*
   (He said) Come,
   Anyone who wants deny yourself,
   Take up your cross, follow me;
   No matter the cost
   Be my heart, my hands, my voice.

*Bridge:*

   Whoever wants to save
                   |9|
    his life will lose it;
    |1|*m*              |11|
   Whoever wants to save
                   |9|
    his life will lose it.
    |1|*m*               |11|
   Whoever loses his life
                      |9|
    for my sake will find it;
    |1|*m*               |11|
   Whoever loses his life
                      |9|
    for my sake will find it.
