*1.* Great God and Savior of mankind,
      |9|               |2|
   I give myself to Thee;
               |11|*m*                |9|*sus4*
   There is no one that loves me so—
      |4|*m*       |9|      |2| *–* |2|*7*
   A faithful God to me.
        |7|        |4|*m*               |2|
   My Friend in times of trouble sore,
      |9|        |9|*7*      |2|
   A constant loving Guide;
    |9|   |2|*/*|6|  |11|*m*         |9|*sus4*
   Thy name alone will I adore
        |4|*m*       |9|      |2|
   And e’er in Thee confide.

*2.* O Holy One from heav’n above,
   My life belongs to Thee.
   Whom else on earth could I
    desire?
   To Thee I’ll faithful be.
   My refuge from the swelling tide,
   A shelter from the storm,
   In Thee alone my soul can hide;
   I want to know Thee more.

*3.* Thou callest me to follow Thee,
   So joyfully I’ll go;
   Where’er the hand of God
    may lead
   I shall not be alone.
   My Bridegroom
    and my coming King,
   My soul doth wait for Thee.
   My longing is for Thee alone—
   Thy glorious face to see.

*4.* And soon the trumpet will resound
   Thy glory fill the sky;
   Then in the clouds
   I’ll meet my Lord
   Transported, I shall rise—
   To see my Savior face to face
   And e’er with Him abide,
   Fulfillment of His wondrous grace
   My longing satisfied.
