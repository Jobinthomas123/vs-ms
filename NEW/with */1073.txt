*1.* Wonderful Savior,

    You are my Lord;

   O great Redeemer,
   |11|*m*          |6|*7*

    nothing more.

*2.* You are the potter; we are the clay.
   Mold us and make us,
    shape us Your way.
   Fill and revive, Lord,
    change us we pray;
   Help us stand firm in the faith.

*3.* You are our Captain;
   You lead the way.
   Strengthen our soul
    to fight night and day!
   Cast out our foes,
    and free us today;
   Vict’ry is ours in Your name.

*4.* You are our Comfort;
   You give us grace
   When faced with trials,
    sorrow and pain.
   We’re filled with hope
    as we watch and wait;
   Soon You will catch us away.

*5.* You are the Bridegroom;
   We wait for You—
   Your love transforming,
    making us new.
   Jesus, we’ll serve You
    in gratitude;
   Your shining city in view.
