*Chorus:*
     |0|            |0|*/*|4|
   Setting our affections
         |5|      |0|
    on things above—

   Jesus is coming soon.

*1.* From the dunghill He has raised us,
                |2|*m*        |7|       |0|
   Cleansed us from the stain of sin,
            |5|       |7|
   Made us His own sons
          |9|*m*
    and daughters—
                |2|*7*           |7|
   Through the veil to enter in.

*2.* Now we’re risen with Christ Jesus,
   Seeking only things above
   Where He’s seated with the Father
   Interceding in His love.

*3.* Though the devil tries to sway us
   From the path of truth and light,
   Jesus, our great Shepherd-leader
   Guides us in the way that’s right.

*4.* There in heaven saints are waiting
   Those in vict’ry gone before,
   So be strong, we too can conquer,
   Soon the battle will be o’er.

*5.* As we fix our gaze upon Him,
   Trusting in His help alone
   And we lift our voice rejoicing
   We will reach His glorious throne.

*6.* Shouts of joy
    when we shall see Him;
   Oh, the rapture of that day.
   Then forever we’ll adore Him
   Who redeemed us by His grace.
