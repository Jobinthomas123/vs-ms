*1.* You are always fighting for us—
            |6|*m*
   Heaven's angels all around;
          |11|*m*
   My delight is found in knowing
            |4|*sus4*               |4|
   That You wear the Victor's crown.
             |6|*m*
   You're my help and my defender;
              |9|
   You're my Savior and my friend.
              |11|*m*               |9|
   By Your grace I live and breathe
                |4|
    to worship You.

*2.* At the mention of Your greatness,
   In Your name I will bow down;
   In Your presence fear is silent,
   For You wear the Victor's crown.
   Let Your glory fill this temple;
   Let Your power overflow.
   By Your grace I live and breathe
    to worship You.

*Chorus:*
         |2| *–* |4| *–* |9|
   Hallelu   —   jah,
             |2|  |9|
   You have overcome,
             |4|  |11|*m*
   You have overcome.
         |2|*–*|4|*–*|6|*m*
   Hallelu — jah,
                    |11|*m*  |4|*7*
   Jesus, You have overcome
         |9|   *(if going to the verse:* |2|*)*
    the world.

*3.* You are ever interceding
   As the lost become the found.
   You can never be defeated,
   For You wear the Victor's crown.
   You are Jesus the Messiah;
   You're the Hope of all the world.
   By Your grace I live and breathe
    to worship You.

*Bridge:*
|2| *-*                  |9|
   Every high thing must come down
|4| *-*                   |11|*m*
   Every stronghold shall be broken;
|2| *-*              |9|
   You wear the Victor's crown.
    |4|             |11|*m*
   You overcome, You overcome.

*4.* At the cross the work was
    finished;
   You were buried in the ground,
   But the grave could
    not contain You
           |2|*maj7*     |4|         |9|
   For You wear the Victor's crown.
