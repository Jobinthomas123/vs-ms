              |2|
*1.* There’s a longing inside
                     |7|          |2|*/*|6|
   This world could never satisfy;
                |2|         |11|*m*
   There’s a freedom we crave
              |4|*7/*|8|          |9|
   Beyond the pow’r of the grave.
              |7|            |2|
   When this life’s at an end,
                |6|        |11|*m*
   The new one merely begins—
                  |7|       |4|*m*
   A place where joy overflows
               |9|*7*          |2|
   And I find rest for my soul.

*Chorus:*
   |4|*7*     |9|
   How I long to see the day
                  |7|           |2|
   When earth’s shadows flee away;
   |4|*7*   |9|
   In heaven’s bright light
                 |7|              |11|*m*
   Such beauty right before my eyes.
           |7|          |4|*m*
   Jesus’ face I will see
            |6|*m*         |11|*m*
   And like Him I will be—
    |11|*7*       |4|*m*           |7|
   Gone the pain and the past
         |9|       |2|
   I am home at last.

*2.* The sufferings of life,
   Persecutions that arise,
   They can never compare
   To that great glory over there.
   What may come, what may pass—
   The faith inside it will last,
   And it grows through the trials
   Like gold, it shines in the fire.

*3.* When the battle is hard
   And fear is gripping the heart,
   Jesus will be right there;
   He’s interceding in prayer.
   We will see ourselves changed
   Although the problems remain,
   And now the hope in our souls
   Each day much brighter it grows.
