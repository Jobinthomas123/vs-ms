*2.* Crown the Savior!
   Angels, crown Him!
   Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
   On the seat of power
    enthrone Him
   While the vault of heaven rings.
   Crown Him! Crown Him!
   Crown Him, you saints,
    His praises sing.
   Crown Him! Crown Him!
   Crown the Savior King of kings.

*3.* Sinners in derision crowned Him,
   Mocking thus the Savior's claim;
   Saints and angels
    crowd around Him,
   Own His title, praise His name.
   Crown Him! Crown Him!
   Lift high the banner of His name
   Crown Him! Crown Him!
   Spread abroad the Victor's fame!

*4.* Hark, those bursts of acclamation!
   Hark, those loud
    triumphant chords!
   Jesus takes the highest station;
   Oh, what joy the sight affords!
   Crown Him! Crown Him!
   Jesus, our Champion
    the final word.
   Crown Him! Crown Him!
   King of kings and Lord of lords!
