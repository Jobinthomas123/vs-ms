              |2|
*1.* When the trumpet of the Lord

    shall sound,
        |7|                |2|
   And time shall be no more,

   And the morning breaks,
                         |9|*7*
   Eternal, bright and fair;
             |2|
   When the saved of earth

    shall gather
        |7|              |2|
   Over on the other shore,
           |2|*/*|9|                |9|*7*
   And the roll is called up yonder,
              |2|
    I'll be there.

*Chorus:*
             |2|
   When the roll is called up yonder,
             |9|*7*
   When the roll is called up yonder,
             |2|                |7| *â€“* |4|*m*
   When the roll is called up yonder,
            |2|*/*|9|                |9|*7*
   When the roll is called up yonder,
             |2|
   I'll be there.

*2.* On that bright and
    cloudless morning
   When the dead in Christ shall rise,
   And the glory of His
    resurrection share;
   When His chosen ones shall gather
   To their home beyond the skies,
   And the roll is called up yonder,
    I'll be there.

*3.* Let us labor for the Master
   From the dawn till setting sun;
   Let us talk of all His wondrous
    love and care;
   Then when all of life is over,
   And our work on earth is done,
   And the roll is called up yonder,
   I'll be there.
