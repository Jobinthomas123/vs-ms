              |9|         |9|*/*|1|
*1.* There’s a song in my heart
        |11|*m*
    that I cannot deny;
             |4|      |11|*7*    |4|*sus*  *-* |4|
   It’s the song my Jesus gave me
            |9|     |9|*/*|1|
   When He lifted me out
    |11|*m*
    of the miry clay,
              |4|             |9| *-* |4|*m*
   And washed all my sins away.

*Chorus:*
     |9|*7*         |2| *-* |11|*m*
   Praise the Lord!
                |9| *-* |6|*m*
   Praise His name!
       |11|*m7*     |4|           |9| *-* |9|*/*|1|
   He alone deserves all praise,
             |2|          |6|*m*
   And this song I will raise
          |11|*m*       |4|      |9|
   'Til I see His loving face.

*2.* Oh, this song that I sing—
    it was not here before,
   But when Jesus came
    He brought it.
   Now my days are filled
    with overflowing joy;
   I rejoice in Him alone!

*3.* In the darkest of nights
    this melody remains,
   Springing up with joyful praises.
   As I sing to Him, His glory
    fills my soul,
   Giving strength to carry on.

*4.* In the morn when I rise,
   I hear it once again;
   It's a song that has no ending.
   Though the tune may change,
    the message stays the same—
   The great message of His love.

*5.* When the battle is strong,
   I still can hear the song,
   For my Captain goes forth singing.
   I find courage
    when I hear His melody;
   'Tis the song of victory.

*6.* There's a tune that attracts
    the ear of my Beloved;
   It's the song of His redeemed ones.
   Though the angels praise Him,
    singing all the time,
   Jesus longs to hear His bride.

*7.* If you’re listening today
    and have no song within,
   Come to Jesus— He will save you.
   Then from deep inside
    you’ll hear the song begin,
   As He fills your heart with joy.
