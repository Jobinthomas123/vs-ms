Every day with Jesus
     |1|*7*                   |6|*m*
 is sweeter than the day before;
                |11|*7*
Every day with Jesus,
  |6|*m*       |11|*7*       |4|
I love Him more and more.
                |4|*maj7*
Jesus saves and keeps me;
|4|*7*                       |9|
He’s the One I’m waiting for—

Every day with Jesus
    |6|*m*             |11|*7*     |4|
is sweeter than the day before.
