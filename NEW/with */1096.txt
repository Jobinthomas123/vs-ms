*1.* Father, we are waiting here
        |9| *-*
    for  You;
    |11|*m*
   Come and overwhelm us
               |4|*m*
    with Your love.
        |2|
   Surround us with Your glory
          |9| *-*
    now we pray;
    |11|*m*
   Draw us nearer to
                  |4|*m*
    Your secret place.

*Chorus:*
            |7|       |9|
   May we abide in You,
    |11|*m*
   Keep our hearts from
               |7|
    wandering away.

   May we remain
                     |9|
    hidden in Your grace,
      |11|*m*
   Forever in Your perfect
               |7|
    peace to stay.

*2.* Jesus, come and cleanse
    our lives today;
   Purify us, Lord,
    now with Your fire.
   O holy God, break our hearts
    for our sins,
   Mold us to Your good
    and perfect will.

*Bridge:*
    |11|*m*
   Holy Spirit speak,
     |9|
   Call unto the deep,
     |11|*m*          |6|*m*
   Drawing us to You, Lord;
    |7|
   Father, hear our plea
    |9|
   For our greatest need
   |4|*m*             |9|
   Is that we be holy.
