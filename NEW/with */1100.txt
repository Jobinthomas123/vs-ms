             |4|           |9|
*1.* When the day of Pentecost
               |4|
    was fully come,
                              |1|*m*
   From the dwelling place of God
                  |11|
    there came a sound
         |8|*m*           |1|*m*
   Of a rushing mighty wind,
           |8|*m*                |1|*m*
    As the Holy Ghost stepped in,
         |6|*m*               |11|*7*
   Their souls were set ablaze
             |4|
    for the Lord.

*Chorus:*
               |4|*/*|8| *-* |11|*7*
   I want that fire
                  |4|
    blown by the wind;
                      *-* |1|*m*
   That sweet anointing,
                |11|
   From heaven send.
           |4|         |9|
   Rest on me, holy flames;
              |4| *-* |11|*7*     |4|
   Set me on fire once again.

*2.* The outpouring of the Spirit
    as Joel said,
   Came like cloven tongues of fire
    on their heads.
   There all the sons and daughters
   Were filled with living waters—
   Baptized with the Holy Ghost
    and fire.

*3.* God’s fire consumed
    Elijah’s sacrifice
   Though the altar had been watered
    more than twice.
   So whatever be my state,
   In Your presence I will wait,
   'Til the fire of first love
    burns in my heart.

*4.* By a whirlwind up to heaven
    Elijah went,
   On a chariot of fire that was sent.
   And soon You’ll come for me,
   So ready I must be
   To sit upon Your throne of fire.

*Bridge:*
    |4|     |11|*m*                  |9|
   Lord Jehovah, You are the God.
    |11|      |11|*7*                 |4|
   Lord Jehovah, You are the God
       |8|*7*        |1|*m*
   Who answers by fire;
        |11|          |9|
   Come answer by fire,
    |4|         |11|*7*       |4|
   Set us on fire, oh God.
