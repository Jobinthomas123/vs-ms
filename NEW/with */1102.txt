*Chorus:*
               |2|       |9|
   We’re going up when Jesus comes,
                |2|
    We’re going up
                |9|
     with the chosen ones,
                |7|
    We’re going up—
        |11|*m*     |9|     |7|
     O angels step aside;
             |2|      |9|
   Heavenly hosts arise—
       |7|        |9|         |2|
   Receive the raptured bride.

        |7|                  |2|
*1.* The day of Christ will come
        |7|                 |2|
   When we will be caught up.
              |0|                |7|
   We’ll be clothed in linen white;
         |6|*m7*              |9|
   The church of God will rise.

*2.* A mystery unfolds
   When we, the bride, will go;
   Those dead in Christ will rise
   To meet Him in the sky.

*3.* What feasting will be there
   In the New Jerusalem;
   We’ll walk the streets of gold—
   It’s time for us to go!

*4.* Spirit and bride say, “Come”;
   The trump begins to sound,
   The Son of God descends
   As the bride of Christ ascends.
