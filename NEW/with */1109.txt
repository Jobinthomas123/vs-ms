          |4|
Just one word from heaven
    |11|*7*                 |4|
And sinners are made whole;
                   |1|*m7*
Just one word from heaven
     |6|*7*               |11|*7*
And freedom takes control.
        |1|*m*      |8|*7/*|0|
From the lips of Jesus,
      |4|*/*|11|      |6|*m7*
Mercy calls my name.
          |4|*/*|11|     |1|*m7-*|6|*7*
Just one word from heaven,
         |9|*/*|11|    |11|*7*      |4|
And weâ€™ll never be the same.
