*1.* All my life long  I had panted
           |5|*2*
   For a drink from
                |7|*sus -* |7|
    some cool spring,
     |5|     |0|
   That I hoped would
     |5|*2*         |0|
    quench the burning
          |2|*m7*      |7|*sus-*|7| *-*|0|
   Of the thirst I felt within.

*Chorus:*
    |5|    |0|     |5|       |0|
   Hallelujah! I have found Him
           |7|*sus*
   Whom my soul
                  |7|   *-*|7|*7*
    so long has craved!
         |0|     |5|       |0|
   Jesus satisfies my longing;
      |5|         |9|*m*
   Through His blood
       |7|      |0|
    I now am saved.

*2.* Feasting on the husks around me
   Till my strength was almost gone;
   Longed my soul for
    something better,
   Only still to hunger on.

*3.* Poor I was, and
    sought for riches—
   Something that would satisfy;
   But the dust I gathered round me
   Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.

*4.* Well of water—ever springing,
   Bread of life, so rich and free,
   Untold wealth that never faileth,
   My Redeemer is to me.
