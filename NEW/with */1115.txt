*Chorus:*
               |2|
   It will be worth it all
              |4|*m*
    to see my Jesus;
               |9|
   It will be worth it all
                           |2|
    just to see His face alone.
       |9|*/*|2|     |2|
   It will be worth it all
              |4|*m*
    to see my Jesus
           |7|              |9|
   In His glory and His splendor
              |2|
    on His throne.

                               |2|
*1.* I will walk the streets of heaven
      |7|          |9|
    leaping for joy,
     |7|               |9|
   Shouting highest praises
     |7|              |2|
    to the King of kings.
          |4|*m*                 |2|
   I will give Him all the glory
        |7|                |9|
    for all that He has done,
    |7|             |9|
   Singing, “Hallelujah!”
        |7|       |9|      |2|
    My joy has just begun!

*2.* Oh, my heart could ne’er imagine
    what He’s prepared
   For all those who love Him
    throughout eternity.
   But my joy will be to see Him,
    that’s what I’m waiting for;
   Trials will be over—
    I’ll serve Him evermore.
