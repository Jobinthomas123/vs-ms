*1.* To the work! To the work!

   We are servants of God;
          |7|*sus4*       |2|*7*
   Let us follow the paths
             |7|          |7|*7*
   That our Master has trod.
             |0|
   With the balm of His counsel,

   Our strength to renew;
          |7|*sus4*        |2|*7*
   Let us do with our might
             |7|            |7|*7*
   What our hands find to do.

*Chorus:*
            |0|           |7|*sus4 -* |7|
   Toiling on...toiling on.
           |2|*m-*|7|*7-*       |0|
   Toiling on...toiling on.
             *-*|0|*/*|4|        |5| *-*  |2|*m*
   Let us hope, let us watch,
   |3|*dim-*|0|*/*|4|   |5|*sus2*     |0|*/*|7|*-*|7|*7* |0|
   And   labor till the Master comes.

*2.* To the work! To the work!
   Let the hungry be fed;
   To the fountain of life
   Let the weary be led!
   In the cross and its banner
   Our glory shall be,
   While we herald the tidings,
   “Salvation is free!”

*3.* To the work! To the work!
   There is labor for all,
   For the kingdom of darkness
   And error shall fall;
   And the name of Jehovah
   Exalted shall be,
   In the loud-swelling chorus,
   “Salvation is free!”

*4.* To the work! To the work!
   In the strength of the Lord,
   And a robe and a crown
   Shall our labor reward.
   When the home of the faithful
   Our dwelling shall be,
   And we shout with the ransomed,
   “Salvation is free!”
