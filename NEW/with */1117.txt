*(Key of* |2|*)*
*Chorus:*
       |11|*m*
   The battles that we face

    are the Lord’s;
        |9|
   Our lives are hid
                   |4|*m*
    with Christ in God.
      |7|
   Jesus, the Lord of battles,
     |2|          |11|*m*
    our warfare handles—
      |9|
   Before His might
                   |2|
    no enemy can stand.

   |11|*m*
*1.* We do not wrestle
       |9|
    against flesh and blood
             |7|
   But with rulers of darkness
         |6|
    and warriors thereof.
           |11|*m*
   They’re taller than cedars
           |9|
    and stronger than oaks;
      |7|
   Against us, they come
          |6|
    to destroy us with their strokes.

*Pre-chorus:*
              |11|*m*
   But He Who slew great
                 |9|
    and famous kings
                 |4|*m*
   Protects His children
               |11|*m*
    under His wings.
             |11|*m*                 |9|
   He’s our Captain within the veil,
                    |4|*m*             |7|
   So the gates of hell cannot prevail.

*2.* We can’t be blind to
    the enemy’s schemes--
   Be aware that he works
    to entrap the redeemed.
   He roars like a lion, is sly as a fox,
   And seeks to devour our souls
    with all his plots.

*Pre-chorus:*
   But He Who slew
    great and famous kings
   Protects His children
    under His wings.
   At the cross where
    His blood was shed,
   He has crushed for us
    the serpent’s head.

*Bridge:*
               |11|*m*
   Behold, He comes and
                  |2|
    stands by my side,
                         |9|
   Military power to provide.
      |4|*m*
   I stand still in knowing through
           |2|
    the brightness of His coming
    |9|
   They’ll take flight,
                  |2|        |2|*7*
    for Him they dare not fight.
       |7|
   I claim the victory over
    |2|
    every enemy
          |9|
   And rejoice, for the battle
            |2|
    is the Lord’s.
