*1.* My life is hid with Christ in God;
         |7|             |2|
   I’m crucified with Him.

   O hope of glory—Christ in me,
 |7|*m6-*|2|*/*|9|      |9|*7*       |2|
   A new joy now within.

*Chorus:*
     |2|              |9|
   Christ liveth in me!
    |11|*m*              |6|
   Christ liveth in me!
   |7|                 |2|*/*|6|*-*|11|*m*
   Oh, great is this mystery,
   |7|*m6*   |2|*/*|9|    |9|*7*       |2|
   That Christ liveth in me.

*2.* Through grace accepted
    drawn to Thee,
   Beloved of my soul.
   Eternal purpose now unveiled,
   Makes me complete and whole.

*3.* Exceeding greatness of His power
   To me hath He revealed;
   Inheritance with saints in light
   Is mine—in Him I’m sealed.

*4.* Kept in the mighty power of God,
   With confidence enshrined.
   Enriched with glory, treasure rare,
   My life through Him refined.

*5.* Thy all-consuming love divine
   Transforms my inner life.
   Lo! Now my heart
    enthralled by Thee,
   Forsakes this world of strife.
