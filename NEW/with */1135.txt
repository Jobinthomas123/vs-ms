*1.* What gift of grace
                  |5|*/*|0|
   Is Jesus my redeemer;
                |0|
   There is no more
                     |7|*sus-*|7|
   For heaven now to give.
             |0|
   He is my joy,
                          |0|*/*|5|*-*|0|*sus2/*|5|
   My righteousness, and freedom,
                 |0|*/*|7|
   My steadfast love,
                |7|*7*        |0|*sus-*|0|
   My deep and boundless peace.
             |5|*sus2*
   To this I hold,
                  |0|*/*|4|
    my hope is only Jesus;
           |5|
   For my life
        |0|*/*|4|            |7|*sus-*|7|
    is wholly bound to His.
               |0|        |5|*sus2/*|2|
   Oh, how strange and divine;
         |0|*/*|4|          |5|*sus2*
   I can sing, all is mine—
         |0|*/*|7|               |7|*sus*      |0|
   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.

*2.* The night is dark,
   But I am not forsaken;
   For by my side,
   The Savior He will stay.
   I labor on
   In weakness and rejoicing,
   For in my need
   His power is displayed.
   To this I hold,
   My Shepherd will defend me;
   Through the deepest valley
   He will lead.
   Oh, the night has been won,
   And I shall overcome—
   Yet not I,
    but through Christ in me.

*3.* No fate I dread;
   I know I am forgiven.
   The future sure—
   The price it has been paid;
   For Jesus bled
   And suffered for my pardon,
   And He was raised
   To overthrow the grave.
   To this I hold,
   My sin has been defeated;
   Jesus now and ever is my plea.
   Oh, the chains are released;
   I can sing I am free—
   Yet not I,
    but through Christ in me.

*4.* With every breath
   I long to follow Jesus,
   For He has said
   That He will bring me home.
   And day by day
   I know He will renew me,
   Until I stand
   With joy before the throne.
   To this I hold,
    my hope is only Jesus;
   All the glory evermore to Him.
   When the race is complete,
   Still my lips shall repeat—
   Yet not I,
    but through Christ in me.
