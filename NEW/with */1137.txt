*1.* My God is awesome––
                  |11|
    He can move mountains,
                  |1|*m*
   Keep me in the valley,
                      |9|
    hide me from the rain.

   My God is awesome––
                        |11|
    heals me when I’m broken,

   Strength where I’ve been
     |1|*m*
    weakened;
                    |9|
   Forever He will reign.

*Chorus:*
              |4|        |11|
   My God is awesome, awesome,
   |1|*m*       |9|
   awesome, awesome.

*2.* My God is awesome––
    Savior of the whole world,
   Giver of salvation;
    by His stripes I am healed.
   My God is awesome––
    today I am forgiven,
   His grace is why I’m living,
    praise His holy name.
