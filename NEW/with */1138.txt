*Chorus:*
    |9|
   Bigger than all my problems,
    |2|                   |9|
   Bigger than all my fears;
   |4|*7*      |9|               |6|*m7*
   God is bigger than any mountain
           |9|             |4| *–* |4|*7*
   That I can or cannot see.
    |9|
   Bigger than all my questions,
    |2|               |9|
   Bigger than anything;
    |4|*7*     |9|              |6|*m7*
   God is bigger than any mountain
          |4|*7*             |9|
   That I can or cannot see.

    |9|
*1.* Bigger than all the shadows
         |2|              |9|
   That fall across my path;
   |4|*7*      |9|               |6|*m7*
   God is bigger than any mountain
           |9|             |4|*–*|4|*7*
   That I can or cannot see.
    |9|
   Bigger than all the confusion,
    |2|              |9|
   Bigger than anything;
   |4|*7*      |9|               |6|*m7*
   God is bigger than any mountain
          |4|*7*             |9|
   That I can or cannot see.

*2.* Bigger than all the giants––
   Fear and unbelief;
   God is bigger than any mountain
   That I can or cannot see.
   Bigger than all my hang ups,
   Bigger than anything;
   God is bigger than any mountain
   That I can or cannot see.
