*1.* There is strength
                |2|
    within the sorrow;
 |4|*–*                         |9|
   There is beauty in our tears.
|6|*m–*
   And You meet us
              |2|
    in our mourning
 |4|*–*                            |9|
   With a love that casts out fear.

*2.* You are working in our waiting––
   Sanctifying us,
   When beyond our understanding
   You’re teaching us to trust.

*Chorus:*
          |2|                  |9|
   Your plans are still to prosper,
           |4|            |6|*m*
   You’ve not forgotten us,
           |2|              |9|
   You’re with us in the fire
              |4|
    and the flood.
    |2|          |9|      |4|         |6|*m*
   Faithful forever, perfect in love,
            |2|        |4|    |9|
   You are sov’reign over us.

*3.* You are wisdom unimagined;
   Who could understand Your ways?
   Reigning high above the heavens,
   Reaching down in endless grace.

*4.* You’re the lifter of the lowly,
   Compassionate and kind;
   You surround and You uphold me,
   And Your promises are my delight.

   Even what the enemy means
        |2|
    for evil,
                        |11|*m7*
   You turn it for our good;
                        |4|*/*|8|
   You turn it for our good

   And for Your glory.
  |9|*–*
   Even in the valley
             |2|
    You are faithful;
                           |11|*m7*
   You’re working for our good,
                           |4|*/*|8|
   You’re working for our good

   And for Your glory.
