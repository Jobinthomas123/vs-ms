*Chorus:*
        |4|
   He abides! He abides!
        |6|*m*        |11|*7*         |4|
   Hallelujah, He abides with me!
    |11|*7*    |4|                 |4|*7*
   I’m rejoicing night and day
         |9|              |6|*m*
   As I walk the narrow way,
            |11|         |11|*7*         |4|
   For the Comforter abides with me.

          |4|                |4|*7*
*1.* I’m rejoicing night and day
         |9|               |6|*m*
   As I walk the pilgrim way,
            |11|             |11|*7*
   For the hand of God in all
               |4|
    my life I see.
    |11|*7*      |4|            |4|*7*
   And the reason of my bliss,
              |9|           |6|*m*
   Yes, the secret all is this––
             |11|         |11|*7*         |4|
   That the Comforter abides with me.

*2.* Once my heart was full of sin,
   Once I had no peace within
   Till I heard how Jesus died
    upon the tree.
   Then I fell down at His feet,
   And there came a peace so sweet;
   Now the Comforter abides with me.

*3.* There’s no thirsting for the things
   Of the world;
    they’ve taken wings.
   Long ago I gave them up,
    and instantly
   All my night was turned to day,
   All my burdens rolled away;
   Now the Comforter abides with me.

*4.* He is with me ev’rywhere,
   And He knows my ev’ry care.
   I’m as happy as a bird and just as free.
   For the Spirit has control,
   Jesus satisfies my soul;
   Since the Comforter abides with me.
