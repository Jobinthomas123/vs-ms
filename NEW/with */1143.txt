   |9|
*1.* I was a wretch;
       |6|*m*
    I remember who I was.
          |2|           |9|*/*|1|
   I was lost, I was blind,
           |11|*7*             |4|
    I was running out of time.
    |9|
   Sin separated;
         |6|*m*
    the breach was far too wide––
                 |2|                |9|*/*|1|
   But from the far side of the chasm
        |11|*7*              |4|
   You held me in Your sight.

*2.* So You made a way
    across the great divide,
   Left behind heaven’s throne
    to build it here inside.
   There at the cross
    You paid the debt I owed,
   Broke my chains, freed my soul;
   For the first time I had hope.

*Chorus*:
      |9|
   Thank You, Jesus,
              |2|        |9|
    for the blood applied;
               |6|*m*
   Thank You, Jesus,
            |11|*7*        |4|
    it has washed me white.
     |6|*m*  |4|    |2|*-*|9|
   Thank You, Jesus,
    |9|*/*|1|       |2|   |4|  |6|*m*
    You have saved my life;
     |2|                 |9|*/*|1|
   Brought me from the darkness
          |9|*/*|4| *-* |4|   |9|
    into glorious light.

3. You took my place,
    laid inside my tomb of sin.
   You were buried for three days;
   But then
    You walked right out again!
   And now death has no sting
    and life has no end,
   For I have been transformed
    by the blood of the Lamb.

*Bridge:*
     |2|
   There is nothing stronger
             |4|
   Than the wonder-working power
           |6|*m*        |1|*m*
   Of the blood, the blood––
         |2|
   That calls us sons and daughters.
           |4|
   We are ransomed by our Father
                 |6|*m*
   Through the blood,
         |1|*m* *(going to chorus:* |4|*)*
    the blood.
