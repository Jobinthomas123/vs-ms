            |9|
Put on the garment of praise
          |2|        |11|*m7*
For the spirit of heaviness;
 |9|            |6|*m*      |4|
Lift up your voice and sing.
  |9|           |9|*7*
Pray in the Spirit
|2|               |11|*m*
And with understanding,
|9|        |4|       |9|
Oh, magnify His name.
