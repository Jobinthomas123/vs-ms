*1.* Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;
    |4|*7*                      |9|
   Sing His mercy and His grace.
           |9|*7*     |2|          |11|*m7*
   In the city, bright and blessed,
    |9|        |4|             |9|
   He’ll prepare for us a place.

*Chorus*
           |9|*-*|2|*/*|9|       |9|
   When we all get to heaven,
                    |11|*7*
   What a day of rejoicing
               |4|
    that will be!
           |9|        |2|  *-*|11|*m*
   When we all see Jesus,
         |9|          |4|             |9|
   We’ll sing and shout the victory.

*2.* While we walk the
    pilgrim pathway,
   Clouds will over-spread the sky;
   But when trav’ling days are over,
   Not a shadow, not a sigh.

*3.* Let us then be true and faithful—
   Trusting, serving ev’ry day.
   Just one glimpse of Him in glory
   Will the toils of life repay.

*4.* Onward to the prize before us!
   Soon His beauty we’ll behold.
   Soon the pearly gates will open;
   We shall tread the streets of gold!
