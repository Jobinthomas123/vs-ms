*1.* I know not why

    God’s wondrous grace
                       |7|
   To me He hath made known,
         |0|
   Nor why, unworthy,

    Christ in love
      |7|        |7|*7*      |0|
   Redeemed me for His own.

*Chorus:*
    |0|*7*    |5|
   But I know Whom
              |0|
    I have believed, and
          |7|                 |0|
   Am persuaded that He is able
       |5|
   To keep that which
            |0|
    I’ve committed
        |7|     |7|*7*          |0|
   Unto Him against that day.

*2.* I know not how this saving faith
   To me He did impart,
   Nor how believing in His Word
   Wrought peace within my heart.

*3.* I know not how the Spirit moves,
   Convincing men of sin,
   Revealing Jesus thro’ the Word,
   Creating faith in Him.

*4.* I know not when
    my Lord may come,
   At night or noonday fair,
   But when He comes I’ll go
    with Him
   To meet Him in the air!
