*1.* I come to the garden alone
              |0|
   While the dew is still
            |7|
    on the roses,
            |2|*7*
   And the voice I hear,
            |7|
    falling on my ear,
        |9|*7*             |2|*–*|9|*-*|2|*7*
   The Son of God discloses.

*Chorus:*
           |7|
   And He walks with me,
           |2|*7*
   And He talks with me,
           |9|*m7*
   And He tells me
    |2|*7*       |7|
    I am His own.
                    |11|*7*
   And the joy we share
           |0|      |9|*7*
    as we tarry there,
         |7|        |2|*7*     |7|
   None other has ever known.

*2.* He speaks and the sound
    of His voice
   Is so sweet
    the birds hush their singing.
   And the melody
    that He gave to me
   Within my heart is ringing.

*3.* I’d stay in the garden with Him,
   Tho’ the night around me be
    falling.
   But He bids me go thro’ the voice
    of woe;
   His voice to me is calling.
