*1.* New, every morning it’s new!
                |4|
   The love of God to me is
     |11|*7*          |4|
    wonderfully new!
                           |9|
   New, every morning it’s new!
             |4|
   The mercy of the Lord is
     |11|*7*          |4|
    wonderfully new.
     |11|*7*
   Great is His faithfulness,
     |4|       |11|*7*      |4|
    constant is His love,
    |11|*7*
   Great is His saving pow’r
     |4|      |6|*7*   |11|*7*
    coming from above!

*Chorus:*
    |4|                       |9| |6|*m*
   New, every morning it’s new!
             |4|
   The mercy of the Lord is
     |6|*m*   |11|*7*    |4|
    wonderfully new.

*2.* New, ev’ry morning it’s new!
   The love of Calvary is
    wonderfully new!
   New, ev’ry morning it’s new!
   The mercy fresh outpoured
    is wonderfully new!
   He is our daily strength;
   He’s our daily guide
   If we will wait on Him
    and in Him abide!

*3.* New, ev’ry morning it’s new!
   The grace of God to me is
    wonderfully new!
   New, ev’ry morning it’s new!
   His matchless grace to me is
    wonderfully new!
   Grace when the path is drear
    in life’s darkest hour,
   I’ll praise Him all my days,
    for His keeping power.
