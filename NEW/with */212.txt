*1.* All hail the pow’r
        |11|*7*
    of Jesus’ name!
                         |4|
   Let angels prostrate fall;

   Bring forth the royal diadem,
                  |6|     |11|*7*
   And crown Him Lord of all.

   Ye ransomed from the fall,
   Hail Him Who saves you
    by His grace,

*3.* Let ev’ry kindred, ev’ry tribe
   On this terrestrial ball,
   To Him all majesty ascribe,
   And crown Him Lord of all.
   To Him all majesty ascribe,
   And crown Him Lord of all!

*4.* Oh, that with yonder sacred throng
   We at His feet may fall!
   We’ll join the everlasting song,
   And crown Him Lord of all.
   We’ll join the everlasting song,
   And crown Him Lord of all!
