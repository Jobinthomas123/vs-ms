         |4|
*1.* I am looking for the dawning

   When the shadows flee away,

   And our Lord shall come in glory,
            |6|               |11|*7*
   Then to catch His bride away.
           |4|                    |4|*7*
   Oh, my heart is filled with rapture
         |9|                   |4|
   As I wait and watch and pray,
                           |11|*7*
   For our Lord is coming back to
            |4|
    earth again!

*Chorus:*
           |4|
   What a gathering,

   What a gathering in the air—

   Changed in His own likeness,
                  |11|*7*
    glorious and fair.
           |4|
   What a gathering,
           |4|*7*
   What a greeting,
            |9|               |4|
   When we meet Him in the air;
                         |11|*7*
   Hallelujah, when our Jesus
            |4|
    comes again!

*2.* When the sealing work is finished
   And the bride is clothed in white,
   Then the ransomed of the Lord
    shall sing
   From Zion’s mountain height.
   In the glorious reign of Jesus,
   Where there’s love
    and pure delight;
   When our Jesus shall come back
    to earth again!

*3.* Oh, our hearts will thrill
    with rapture
   As we see those mansions fair
   And the patriarchs and prophets,
   And the loved ones gathered there.
   We shall see His beauty
   And behold the land that is afar
   When our Jesus shall come back
    to earth again!

*4.* Oh, be ready for His coming;
   Soon you’ll hear the midnight cry.
   If your consecration slackens,
   Then the Lord will pass you by.
   Oh, the door forever
    will be closed—
   No more to enter in
   When our Jesus shall come back
    to earth again!

*5.* Where the glory of our God
   Doth shine in city crystal fair,
   Sin and sorrow, pain and sickness,
   They can never enter there.
   We shall have the
    Marriage Supper
   In the palace of the King.
   And with Jesus we’ll come back
    to earth again.
