*1.* I came to Jesus
     |9|*m*     |2|*7*        |7|
    weary, worn, and sad;
       |2|*7*
   He took my sins away.
       |7|
   He took my sins away.
                        |9|*m*
   And now His love has made
        |2|*7*        |7|
    my heart so glad;
       |0|       |2|     |7|
   He took my sins away.

*Chorus:*
       |2|*7*
   He took my sins away.
       |7|
   He took my sins away,
        |9|               |9|*7*    |2| *–* |2|*7*
   And keeps me singing ev’ry day!
   |7|               |0|
   I’m so glad He took
              |7|
    my sins away.
      |0|         |2|    |7|
   He took my sins away.

*2.* The load of sin was
    more than I could bear;
   He took them all away.
   He took them all away.
   And now on Him I roll
    my ev’ry care,
   He took my sins away.

*3.* No condemnation
    have I in my heart;
   He took my sins away.
   He took my sins away.
   His perfect peace He did
    to me impart;
   He took my sins away.

*4.* If you will come to
    Jesus Christ today,
   He’ll take your sins away.
   He’ll take your sins away,
   And keep you happy in
    His love each day.
   He’ll take your sins away.
