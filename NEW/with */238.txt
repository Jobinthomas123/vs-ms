*1.* As I journey thro’ the land

    singing as I go,

   Pointing souls to Calvary
    |9|*7*               |2|
    to the crimson flow
    |7|
   Many arrows pierce my soul
      |0|               |7|
    from without, within,
                |4|*m*
   But my Lord leads me on;
       |7|      |2|*7*      |7|
    thro’ Him I must win.

*Chorus:*
  |7|
   Oh, I want to see Him,
    |0|              |7|
    look upon His face,

   There to sing forever
    |9|*7*              |2|
    of His saving grace.
  |7|
   On the streets of glory
     |0|               |7|
    let me lift my voice—
                    |4|*m*
   Cares all past, home at last,
    |7|    |2|*7*     |7|
    ever to rejoice.

*2.* When in service for my Lord
    dark may be the night,
   But I’ll cling more close to Him;
    He will give the light.
   Satan’s snares may vex my soul,
    turn my thoughts aside,
   But my Lord goes ahead,
    leads whate’er betide.

*3.* When in valleys low, I look
    tow’rd the mountain height,
   And behold my Savior there
    leading in the fight.
   With a tender hand outstretched
    tow’rd the valley low,
   Guiding me, I can see,
    as I onward go.

*4.* When before me billows rise
    from the mighty deep,
   Then my Lord directs my bark;
    He doth safely keep.
   And He leads me gently on
    thro’ this world below;
   He’s a real Friend to me,
   Oh, I love Him so!
