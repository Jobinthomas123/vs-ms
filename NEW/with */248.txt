*1.* Thou did’st leave Thy throne and
             |7|  |0|
    Thy kingly crown
              |5|        |0|
   When Thou camest to earth
         |7|
    for me,
           |0|
   But in Bethlehem’s home
                     |7|   |0|
    there was found no room
    |5|       |0|        |7| *-* |0|
   For Thy holy nativity.

*Chorus:*
     |0|           |7|*m7*    |0|*7*   |5|
   O come to my heart, Lord Jesus;
             |0|
   There is room in my heart
          |7|
    for Thee!
      |0|          |7|*m7*
   O come to my heart,
     |0|*7*   |5|      |0|
    Lord Jesus, come—
     |0|
   There is room in my heart
     |7|   |0|
    for Thee!

*2.* Heaven’s arches rang
    when the angels sang,
   Proclaiming Thy royal decree.
   But, in lowly birth
    did’st Thou come to earth
   And in great humility.

*3.* The foxes found rest
    and the birds their nest
   In the shade of the forest tree,
   But Thy couch was the sod,
    O Thou Son of God,
   In the deserts of Galilee.

*4.* Thou camest, O Lord,
    with the living Word
   That should set Thy people free,
   But with mocking scorn
    and with crown of thorn,
   They bore Thee to Calvary.

*5.* When all heaven doth ring
    and her choir shall sing
   At Thy coming to victory,
   Let Thy voice call me home,
    saying, “Yet there is room –
   There is room at My side
    for thee!”

*(Ending)*
            |0|            |7|*m7*
   And, my heart shall rejoice,
     |0|*7*   |5|
    Lord Jesus,
              |0|
   When Thou comest and callest
         |7|
    for me.
             |0|           |7|*m7*
   Yes, my heart shall rejoice,
     |0|*7*   |5|       |0|
    Lord Jesus, when—
     |0|                      |7|
   When Thou comest and callest
         |0|
    for me.
