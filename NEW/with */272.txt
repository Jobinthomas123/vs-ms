*1.* The Lord said to My Lord,
     |7|               |2|*2*
   “Sit at My right hand
     |9|*m*               |0|
   Until I make Thine enemies
       |7|                 |4|
    a footstool for Thy feet.”
            |9|*m*
   Oh, the Lord shall send
         |0|
    His rod of strength
        |7|           |2|*2*
   From out of Mt. Zion, saying,

*Chorus:*
   *x2*
     |9|*m*    |0|           |7|
   “Rule, rule in the midst
         |2|       |9|*m –* |0| *–* |7| *-* |2|
    of thine enemies.”

*2.* And, so it was foretold
    about the coming King,
   Who triumphs over sin and death
   And rules o’er everything.
   From His mighty throne in Zion,
   In that city made by God,
    He says,

*3.* Remember the disciples
    back in Jerusalem;
   They waited in an upper room
   Where the Lord did baptize them
   With His Holy Spirit and fire
   So that they could boldly stand.
    He said,

*4.* And, just as our Lord Jesus
    could not be overcome,
   To us He gave the power to live
    just like God’s only Son.
   Oh, the gates of hell
    shall not prevail
   Against this church I build,
    for you will:
