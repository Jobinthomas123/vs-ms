*1.* Jesus is all the world to me:
       |4|       |11|*7*       |4|
   My life, my joy, my all.
       |11|                  |4|
   He is my strength from day to day;
       |6|*7*              |11|*7*
   Without Him I would fall.
     |4|        |9|*/*|4|     |4|
   When I am sad, to Him I go;
            |9|*/*|4|       |4|
   No other one can cheer me so.
             |4|*dim*
   When I am sad,
                  |4|
    He makes me glad;
   |6|*m7* |11|*7*   |4|
   He’s my Friend.

*2.* Jesus is all the world to me—
   My Friend in trials sore.
   I go to Him for blessings,
   And He gives them o’er and o’er.
   He sends the sunshine
    and the rain;
   He sends the harvest’s
    golden grain—
   Sunshine and rain,
    harvest of grain,
   He’s my Friend.

*3.* Jesus is all the world to me,
   And true to Him I’ll be.
   Oh, how could I this Friend deny,
   When He’s so true to me?
   Following Him I know I’m right.
   He watches o’er me day and night.
   Following Him, by day and
    night—
   He’s my Friend.

*4.* Jesus is all the world to me;
   I want no better friend.
   I trust Him now;
   I’ll trust Him when
    life’s fleeting day shall end.
   Beautiful life with such a Friend,
   Beautiful life that has no end—
   Eternal life, eternal joy,
   He’s my Friend.
