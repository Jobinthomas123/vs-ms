*1.* He is coming soon
            |0|       |9|*m*
   For His faithful bride,
           |7|              |4|*m7*
   Who is purged from all dross
        |9|*7*           |2|
   From self and all pride.
             |7|        |7|*7*
   For, she paid the price,
            |0|       |9|*m*
   Counting all as loss,
           |2|
   Gladly sharing all
        |2|*7*                |7|
   The sufferings of the cross.

*Chorus*
                |2|
   O, Church, awake!
               |7|
   Arise and shine;
               |0|       |9|*m*
   Put on thy strength.
                 |2|  *−* |2|*7*
   Stand in His might;
                 |7|  *−* |7|*7*
   He will not fail.
                  |0|   *−*|9|*m*
   The victory’s thine;
                |7|        |2|      |7|
   Rejoice, He comes in glory bright.

*2.* She rejoiced in hope
   Midst the fiery trials.
   For the vision so great,
   Abstained from all guile.
   Lived a stranger here,
   By the world despised,
   Fighting for the truth
   That fallen man defied.

*3.* Precious is the church,
   Held by Him so dear.
   Now to claim as His own,
   He soon shall appear.
   He hath watched with joy
   All her toil of love;
   She will share His glorious
   Throne in heaven above.

*4.* When our eyes behold
   What His love hath wrought—
   Hid from prophets of old,
   Though earnestly sought,
   With a grateful heart,
   We shall with Him reign,
   Changed to glorious body
   When He comes again.

*5.* Now the night’s far spent,
   Is your armor bright?
   Are you keeping your garments
   Spotless and white?
   Keep your eyes on Him
   While the race you run,
   Then He’ll say to you,
   “Well done, the prize is won.”
