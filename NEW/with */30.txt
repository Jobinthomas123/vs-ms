           |2|
They that wait upon the Lord

  shall renew their strength;
            |9|
They shall mount up
        |9|*7*      |2| *-* |2|*7*
  with wings as eagles.
            |7|
They shall run
              |4|*m*
  and not be weary;
            |2|           |11|*m*
They shall walk and not faint.
           |2|
Teach me, Lord,
           |4|*m7*  |9|   |2|
Teach me, Lord, to wait.
