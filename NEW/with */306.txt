Unto Him that loved us
     |0|                 |9|*m*
And washed us from our sins
   |0|   |5|     |7|
In His own blood,
          |0|
And hath made us
  |5|    |7|     |0|         |9|*m*
Kings and priests unto God
     |0|  |5|  |7|
And His Fatherâ€”

      |5|      |7|
Unto Him be glory
        |0|    |9|*m7*
 and dominion,
 |2|*m7*         |7|     |0|
Forever and ever, Amen.
