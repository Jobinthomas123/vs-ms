                 |7|
Therefore the redeemed

  of the Lord shall return,
               |0|
And come with singing
        |9|*m7*
  unto Zion,
         |7|
And everlasting joy
         |2|*7*             |7|
  shall be upon their heads.

              |0|
They shall obtain
                |7|
  gladness and joy,
     |9|*7*
And sorrow and mourning
              |2|
  shall flee away.
