*1.* There are faces dear
                   |2|*/*|9|
    that I hold in mem’ry,
           |9|         |11|*7*    |4|
   Tho’ I lost them long ago;
            |9|
   But the face of One
                |2|*/*|9|
    altogether lovely,
           |9|          |4|      |9|
   Is the fairest of all I know.

*Chorus:*
    |2|   |9|         |4|            |9|
   His face will outshine them all.
        |2|        |11|*m*            |9|
   His face will outshine them all.
                            |9|*-*|4|*-*|9|
   Glory to the Lamb, Hallelujah!
    |2|   |9|         |4|            |9|
   His face will outshine them all.

*2.* There were voices sweet
    over Bethl’hem singing
   When the Savior Christ was born.
   And, the golden harps of the
    angels ringing
   Broke the tidings that holy morn.

*3.* There are friendly hands
    unto me extended
   When I seem to miss my way,
   But His pierced hand,
    till the march is ended,
   Leadeth up to the realms of day.

*4.* There are worldly things
    that attract the eye—
   Beauty sights o’er land and sea.
   But, when Jesus comes
    in the clouds of heaven,
   Oh, what glory will dawn for me!
