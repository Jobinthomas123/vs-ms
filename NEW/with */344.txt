*Chorus:*
      |2|           —|4|*m*
   A Song of songs,
             |6|*m*        |7|   *—*|4|*m*
   A song of joy to my heart,
              |9|*7*           |2|
   A song of praise to my God,
                 *—*|4|*m*
   A song of hope,
              |6|*m*         |7|   *—*|4|*m*
   A song of faith to my Love,
                |9|*7*            |2|
   A song of rejoicing to my King.

         |4|*m*           |6|*m*   |7|
*1.* Draw me and let us run alone;
 |4|*m*                  |9|
   Bring me to the chambers
             |2|
    of Your love.
 |7|           |9|              |6|*m*
   I will remember all Your love
               |11|*m*
    more than wine.
 |4|*m*                       |9|
   Let Him kiss with the kisses
            |2|   *—-*|2|*7*
    of His love.
 |7|                  |9|
   Behold, You are fair my Love
          |6|*m*           |11|*m*
    and pleasant to my eyes,
 |4|*m*          |9|                    |2|
   I will rejoice and be glad in You.

*2.* Listen, the voice of my Love
    from the hills,
   With joy He is coming forth
    to me.
   He said, “Arise My love
    and come away with Me,
   O My dove, My undefiled,
    My love.
   The time of the singing of the
    birds has come to us;
   Arise My love and come away
    with Me.”

*3.* My Love has gone to His
    garden of love;
   A garden enclosed is where
    He feeds.
   Set me as a seal upon
    Your heart forevermore;
   Many waters can never quench
    our love.
   I am Your beloved and I know
    that You are mine.
   Let me dwell forever in Your love.
