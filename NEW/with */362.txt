          |2|    |9|
*1.* I am Thine, O Lord;
            |2|
   I have heard Thy voice,
           |7|        |4|*m7*     |2|
   And it told Thy love to me.
                |9|
   But, I long to rise
            |2|       |11|*m*
    in the arms of faith
           |4|*m*      |9|       |2|
   And be closer drawn to Thee.

*Chorus:*
              |2|*7*    |7|
   Draw me nearer, nearer,
      |9|      |2|
    blessed Lord,
            |7|
   To the cross where
     |4|*m*       |9|   |9|*7*
   Thou hast died.
            |2|       |2|*7*
   Draw me nearer, nearer,
     |7|               |4|*m*
    nearer, blessed Lord,
           |2|             |9|    |2|
   To Thy precious, bleeding side.

*2.* Consecrate me now
    to Thy service, Lord,
   By the powâ€™r of grace divine.
   Let my soul look up
    with a steadfast hope
   And my will be lost in Thine.

*3.* Oh, the pure delight
    of a single hour
   That before Thy throne I spend.
   When I kneel in prayer,
    and with Thee, my God,
   I commune as friend with friend.

*4.* There are depths of love
    that I cannot know
   Till I cross the narrow sea.
   There are heights of joy
    that I may not reach
   Till I rest in peace with Thee.
