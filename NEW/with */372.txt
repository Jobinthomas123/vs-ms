 |4|
For me to live is Christ;
            |11|
 to die is gainâ€”
            |11|*7*
To hold His hand and walk
             |4|
 the narrow way.
                               |4|*7*
There is no peace, no joy, no thrill
      |9|             |6|*m*
Like walking in His will.
            |4|        |11|
For me to live is Christ;
           |4|
 to die is gain.
