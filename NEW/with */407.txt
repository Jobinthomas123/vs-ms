  |4|          |8|*m*
*1.* I do not know why the
     |1|*m*             |4|*–*|1|*m*
    Savior loves me so,
                   |6|*m*
   Why He gave His life
             |11|
    on Calvary;
   |4|                  |8|*m*
    Oh, what grace divine,
           |1|*m*
   Bowing down to men
        |4|*-*|1|*m*
    so low!
                |6|*m*
   How could He pay such a price
         |11|
    for  me?

*Chorus:*
  |9|              |11|
   It’s only because
                 |4|
   He loves the ones
      |11|*/*|3|           |1|*m*
   He made with His very

    own hands;
  |9|             |11|
   It’s only because He wants
         |4|
    His joy
        |11|*/*|3|    |1|*m*
   And peace to fill our land.
  |9|              |11|             |4|
   It’s only because He is our God!

*2.* His name was Jesus and they
    nailed Him to a cross,
   They just didn’t like the
    things He said;
   Laid Him in His grave
    and this world’s still at loss,
   To explain how He rose
    from the dead.

*3.* Sometimes I wonder why He
    waits so patiently,
   How could He love such a one
    as I?
   Many times I’ve failed
    and I’ve acted foolishly,
   But His goodness He will
    ne’er deny.
