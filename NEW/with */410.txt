*Chorus:*
      |4|          |11|
   My God and my King,
       |9|            |11|
   My joy in everything;
       |4|          |11|
   My God and my King,
            |9|                  |11|
   Oh, the love that You will bring.

           |4|            |8|*m*
*1.* When I look to You above,
        |9|                 |11|
   You rest Your love in me.
              |4|
   On the throne, You’re King
        |8|*m*
    of kings;
            |9|            |11|
   You’re rejoicing over me.

*2.* In the days I feel so down,
   You shed Your love abroad;
   In my sad and lonely times,
   You’re still King inside my heart.

*3.* When in days I seem so bad,
   You rain Your love on me.
   You’re the King from Zion above;
   You came to set me free.

*Ending:*
       |4|          |11|
   My God and my King,
      |9|             |11|
   Forever King of kings;
       |4|          |11|
   My God and my King,
          |4|            |11|
   Oh, forever I will sing,
            |4|
    I will sing.
