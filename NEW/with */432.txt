*1.* Hard times may come
            |7|*6*               |2|
   When I’m walking with my Lord,
                   |6|*m*
   Feel I’m being swept away
        |9|  |4|*7*    |9|
    by tempest storms.
             |2|                 |2|*7*
   But, my roots deeper they grow
               |7|      |4|*m*
   Planted in Jesus’ love;
    |4|*m7*              |6|*m*
   Like a tree, I’m standing firm,
       |7|                 |9|
   And I will never be moved.

*Chorus:*
     |2|
   I’m like a tree that’s planted
     |7|        |2|
    by living waters;

   Hard times they may come,
            |4|*7*
   But the Lord will bring me
       |9|
    through.
        |7|               |2|
   Even in the howling desert,
             |4|*m*               |9|
   When all hope is gone it seems –
   |4|*m*
   I am planted
    |7|        |9|          |2|
    by God’s living stream.
          |7|                  |9|
   When heat and dry times come,
       |11|*m*                    |7|
   My leaf stays fresh and green
         |2|      |11|*m*
   ‘Cause I am planted
    |4|*m7*      |9|         |2|
    by God’s living stream.

*2.* Sometimes I pass
   Through a long and lonely night;
   Clouds of darkness hide His
    face—
   No hope in sight;
   But, I’ll wait, patient in hope,
   Holding His promise sure.
   Like the sun
    at dawn breaks through,
   He’ll shine upon me once more!
