  |2|         |11|*m*       |7|
These things I have spoken
       |9|
 unto you,
         |2|      |11|*m*
That in Me you might
       |0|   *—* |9|
 have peace.
        |2|              |6|*m*
In the world ye shall have
      |11|*m*    *—*|11|*m/*|9|
 tribulation,
     |7|           |9|
But be of good cheer,
|6|*m*          |11|*m*
Be of good cheer,
    |4|*m*          |9|        |2|
For I have overcome the world.
