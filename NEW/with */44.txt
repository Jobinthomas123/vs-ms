Surely goodness and mercy
                         |7|
Shall follow me all the days,
           |7|*7*         |0|
  all the days of my life.

Surely goodness and mercy
                         |7|
Shall follow me all the days,
           |7|*7*         |0|
  all the days of my life.
             |5|
And I will dwell in the house
          |0|
  of the Lord forever,
            |2|*7*
And I will feast at the table
              |7|*7*
  spread for me.

Surely goodness and mercy
                         |7|
Shall follow me all the days,
           |7|*7*         |0|
  all the days of my life.
