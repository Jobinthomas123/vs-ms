*Chorus:*
|7|      |0|       |7|*—*|0|               |7|
   It won’t be long ‘til we see Jesus;
               |9|*m –* |2|*7*
   It won’t be long
                        |7|
    ‘til we’ll be with Him!
       |0|       |7|*—*|0|                |7|
   It won’t be long  ‘til we see Jesus;
               |9|*m –* |2|*7*
   It won’t be long
                            |7|
    ‘til we see Him face to face!

    |9|*m*                  |2|*7*
*1.* Yes, there are many mansions
           |0|                      |7|
    in My Father’s house, it’s true,
       |9|*m*             |2|*7*
   But I will now prepare
               |7|            |7|*7*
    a place especially for you.
   |0|             |9|
   If you, as a faithful bride,
          |7|                 |4|*7*
    will watch and wait for Me,
           |9|*m*                |2|*7*
   I’ll return to catch you away
                 |0|
   That where I am,
                   |7|
    there you may be.

*2.* All of creation’s groaning,
    for it’s longing to be free;
   And all of heaven’s waiting
    for that glorious liberty.
   Lift your eyes and lift your head;
    it is so plain to see
   That salvation’s closer today
   Compared to when you first
    believed.

*3.* Yes, there are many trials,
   But My grace will see you
    through
   If you will fully trust that
    what I promised I will do.
   Don’t let Satan take away
    your faith so dear to Me;
   Overcome him that you may
   Reign upon My throne eternally.
