  Lord, You know I need
      |4|*m*
   a brand new touch;
|9|                   |7|
  My strength from yesterday
       |2|
   is gone.
                           |2|*7*
  But, if You’ll give me, Lord,
     |4|*m*
   another touch,
|9|*7*                                |2|
  I’ll have the strength to carry on!
