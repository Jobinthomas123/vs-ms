*1.* If I had to do it all over again,
              |9|
   I’d serve Jesus ev’ry
     |11|         |4|
    day of my life;

   For I’ve found He alone
         |6|*m*
    can really satisfy
          |9|            |11|
   And deliver me from all
                |4|
    sin and  strife.

*Chorus:*
              |9|                |4|
   Yes, it’s Jesus — the only One,
|6|*m -* |11|     |9|*/*|4|       |4|
   Jesus — God’s only Son.
              |9|
   Yes, it’s Jesus
                     |4|
    Who set my soul free,
             |6|*m*
   And it’s Jesus Christ
            |11|              |4|
    that’s coming back for me!

*2.* If you’re looking for life,
    stop looking right now,
   For it’s Jesus Who can
    give life to you;
   So just open your heart
    and unlock now its door,
   And let Jesus cleanse your life
    through and through.
