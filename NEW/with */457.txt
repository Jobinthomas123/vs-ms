            |2|
*1.* When I first fell in love with Jesus,

   Oh, I gave Him all my heart;

   And I thought I just couldn’t love

    Him more
           |4|*7*               |9|*7*
   Than I did right at the start.
               |2|
   But, now I look back over
         |2|*7*
    the mountains
            |7|
   And the valleys where I’ve been;

   It makes me know that
      |2|
   I love Him so much—
   |4|*m7*       |9|*7*      |2|
   More than I did then!


*Chorus #1:*
           |2|
   I keep falling in love with Him,

   Over and over, and
                    |4|*m7*
    over and over again.
   |9|       |4|*m*                   |9|*7*
   I keep falling in love with Him,
   |4|*m*             |9|*7*
   Over and over, and
    |4|*m*       |9|*7*     |2|
    over and over again.
            |2|
   He gets sweeter and sweeter
            |2|*7*
    as the days go by,
   |7|
   Oh, what a love
                 |7|*m*
    between my Lord and I!
           |2|
   I keep falling in love with Him,
   |9|*7*
   Over and over, and
    |7|         |9|     |2|
    over and over again!

*2.* There’s a hand that I hold on to
   Through each valley and
    each trial;
   There’s a shoulder that I
    lean upon
   As I face another mile.
   And, there’s a love that I can
    depend on;
   It’s fresh and new each day,
   My heart is overflowing with love,
   And that is why I say:

*Chorus #2:*
   I keep falling in love with Him,
   Deeply in love with Him,
   More than my tongue
    can proclaim.
   I keep falling in love with Him,
   Deeply in love with Him,
   My life’s no longer the same.
   I keep wondering and wondering
    the reason why.
   How can He love a one such as I?
   I keep falling in love with Him,
   Over and over, and
    over and over again.
