     |4|                   |4|*2*
*1.* I look up to the mountains;
           |9|*maj7*          |4|
    to the hills I turn my eyes.

   Who will come to help me,
          |4|*4*  |4|        |11|
    oh, where am I to hide?
        |4|                   |4|*2*
   The One who made the heavens
        |4|*7*                  |9|*—*|6|*m*
    and earth will hear my call;
        |4|                     |4|*2*
   The Lord will come to help me,
           |11|        |9|      |4|
    and He will not let me fall.

*Chorus:*
   *x2*
       |4|
   He will not let you fall.
       |9|                |4|
   He will not let you fall.

   He is never weary, and
       |11|        |9|       |4|
   He will not let you fall.


*2.* The One Who watches Israel
    ever will His vigil keep,
   Through the burning sunlight
    and in the darkness deep.
   He’s constantly beside you;
    you need not fear at all.
   The Lord is there to help you,
    and He will not let you fall.

*3.* So when you are in danger,
    when by trouble you are found,
   Your very soul is threatened
    by evil all around;
   In all your ways He’s with you,
    in troubles great and small,
   Now and ever after,
    He will not let you fall.
