*1.* Our God is good
               |6|*m*
   And God is great
        |11|*7*      |4|
   And God is true,

   And there is nothing
             |1|*m7*
    in this world
              |6|*m–*|11|
   He cannot do.
               |4|
   His mighty hands were made
      |4|*7*          |9|*-*|6|*m*
    available to you;
                    |4|
   Oh, praise His name—
              |6|*m*     |11|*7*     |4|
   He’s on the other side of faith!

*Chorus:*
                |6|*m7-*|11|*7*
   Keep pressing on.
                 |4|
   Keep pressing on.
               |1|*m7*
   God’s on the other side
        |6|*m7-*|11|*7*
    of faith;
                  |4|
   And tho’ the clouds may
           |4|*7*              |9|*-*|6|*m*
    for a moment hide His face,
              |4|
   Remember, God is on
        |6|*m*    |11|      |4|
    the other side of faith.

*2.* Now threat’ning clouds may hide
    your vision for a while,
   And you may wonder
    if He hears you
   When you pray;
   But don’t forget that God is love
    and you’re His child.
   Press on in faith because
    the answer’s on the way!

*3.* Now you must run this race
    to win the victor’s crown,
   Though Satan try
    with all his might
   To cast you down;
   It will be worth it just to hear
    God say, “Well done!”
   Press toward the prize
   That’s on the other side of faith!
