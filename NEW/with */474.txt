*1.* What a glory stored in heaven
                    |9|     |2|
   Such as eye has never seen.

   Now a kingdom all through ages

   For the saints from earth
       |9|
    redeemed;
                |7|          |2|
   Where sweet voices ever mingle,
               |7|
   Sound like harps
                  |2|
    before the throne.

   They are firstfruits

    of redemption
                 |9|       |2|
   To His perfect image grown.

*Chorus:*
   See on Zion’s Holy Mount,
     |9|         |2|
    lo, they stand.
                       |9|
   See on Zion’s Holy Mount,
    |4|          |9|*-*|9|*7*
    lo, they stand.
         |2|
   They see the Father’s face,
        |7|                   |2|
   And serve Him night and day;

   See on Zion’s Holy Mount,
    |9|          |2|
    lo, they stand.

*2.* These are they that bring
    Good Tidings;
   On the mountains see their feet.
   They have toiled to make them
    shining,
   And they never knew retreat;
   They with Jesus are now standing,
   Without fault before the throne.
   With a voice that sounds
    like thunder,
   They do sing a brand-new song.

*3.* Serving Me with single vision,
   Hence to Zion called are they;
   From their holy habitation,
   All their strength and zeal display.
   Father’s name in forehead written,
   They forever His shall be;
   God has loved the gates of Zion,
   Joy of all the earth is she.

*4.* Where I am there be My servants
   For they dared to follow Me;
   Once despised on earth
    they wandered
   From dark caves to raging sea.
   Followed Me, the Lamb so gentle,
   Choosing not to seek their plan;
   Reign with Me above all heavens,
   For the race they wholly ran.

*5.* Hear, O earth, for thee
    He’s calling,
   Seeking now the great and small;
   With a lowly heart and tender,
   Trusting Him you’ll never fall.
   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
   Give a signal sign for all;
   Heavens sing with solemn praises,
   Go ye forth for harvest call.
