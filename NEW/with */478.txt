*1.* To Him alone that
     |2|           |9|
    doeth great wonders,
 |4|                   |2|
   To Him Who by His wisdom
              |9|
    made the heavens,
 |4|                     |2|
   To Him Who made the sun
                |9|
    to rule by day,
 |4|                     |2|
   To Him Who made the moon
              |4|              |9|
    and the stars to rule by night.

*2.* To Him Who smote Egypt
    in their firstborn,
   To Him Who brought His people
    out of bondage,
   To Him Who stretched His
    mighty arm of power,
   To Him Who threw Pharoah
    and his host in the Red Sea.

*3.* To Him Who led His people
    through the wilderness,
   To Him Who slew great
    and famous kings,
   To Him Who sees us
    in our low estate,
   To Him Who hath redeemed us
    now from all our enemies.
