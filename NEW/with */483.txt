*1.* Down at the cross
              |0|      |7|
    where my Savior died,
                   |4|*m*
   Down where for cleansing
          |9|*7*     |2|
    from sin I cried—
     |7|          |7|*7*
   There to my heart
              |0|       |7|
    was the blood applied;
          |2|      |7|
   Glory to His name!

*Chorus:*
     |0|           |7|
   Glory to His name!
         |4|*m*     |9|*7-*|2|
   Glory to His name!
     |7|          |7|*7*
   There to my heart
              |0|       |7|
    was the blood applied;
          |2|      |7|
   Glory to His name!

*2.* I am so wondrously
    saved from sin;
   Jesus so sweetly abides within.
   There at the cross
    where He took me in—
   Glory to His name!

*3.* Oh, precious fountain
    that saves from sin—
   I am so glad I have entered in.
   There Jesus saves me
    and keeps me clean;
   Glory to His name!

*4.* Come to the fountain
    so rich and sweet;
   Cast thy poor soul
    at the Savior’s feet.
   Plunge in today
    and be made complete;
   Glory to His name!
