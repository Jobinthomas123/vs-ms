*1.* You are the Light of the world,
       |9|
    O Lord,
        |2|             |4|
   And You make Your servants
     |9|
    shine.
        |2|               |4|
   So, how could there be
         |1|         |6|*m*
    any darkness in me,
       |2|            |4|
   If You are the Light
           |1|*/*|5|*—*|6|*m*
    of the world?
    |2|            |4|           |9|
   You are the Light of the world.

*2.* You are the Bread of Life, O Lord,
   Broken to set us free.
   So, how could there be
    any hunger in me,
   If You are the Bread of Life;
   You are the Bread of Life.

*3.* You’ve overcome the world,
    O Lord,
   And given us victory;
   So, how could I fear
    when the enemy’s near,
   If You’ve overcome the world?
   You’ve overcome the world.

*4.* Wipe every tear away, O Lord,
   And teach us the song
    of the Lamb;
   Your promise is true,
    but it’s still up to You,
   To wipe every tear away,
    wipe every tear away!
