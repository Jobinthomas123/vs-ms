*Chorus:*
 |7|
   Delight yourself
 |9|*m7*
    now in the Lord;
 |11|*m7/*|9|                  |9|*m7*
   Oh, do not fret but cast
              |0|              |7|
    all your cares upon the Lord!

   Then you shall dwell
 |9|*m7*
    in perfect peace,
 |11|*m7/*|9|
   Let’s praise Him now
        |9|*m7*         |2|
   For His faithfulness
                |7|
    will never cease!

 |4|*m*             |2|
*1.* Rest in the Lord,
                 |0|                |7|
    in trusting love wait patiently;
 |4|*m*             |2|          |0|
   All your desire in the Lord
                 |2|
    you shall receive.
 |4|*m*          |2|
   Be now content in Him
          |0|               |7|
    and know what you possess—
 |4|*m*             |2|
   Far greater wealth when you are
     |0|                |9|*—*|9|*m*
    rich in righteousness —
        |0|    |2|*7*  |7|
   His righteousness.

*2.* Commit your ways unto the Lord
    Who cares for you;
   His grace is great and His love
    will bring you through.
   Though you may stumble
    and may find it’s hard to stand,
   Trust in His Word and don’t forget
    Who holds your hand—
   He’ll hold your hand.
