              |2|      |7|
*1.* There’s a city of God
             |2|
    that is made without hands,

   For the saints from all nations
         |9|
    to share,
                |2|            |7|
   Where the streets are of gold
             |2|
    in that radiant land—
                  |2|*/*|9|  |9|      |2|*-*|2|*7*
   Oh, when shall I go o’er there?

*Chorus:*
     |7|
   Jerusalem fair,
       |2|
    I long to be there;
        |9|
   The Lord is now waiting
        |9|*7*          |2|
    to welcome me there!
            |7|
   There’s rest from my toil
         |2|            |11|*m*
    and life without care;
      |2|         |2|*/*|9|    |9|     |2|
   I want to be there sweet home!

*2.* The foundations are twelve,
    what a precious display—
   Glory of His bondservants declare.
   There the wall is of jasper,
    His martyrs portray.
   Oh, when shall I go o’er there?

*3.* There each gate of a pearl
    to the ancients compare,
   Gushing River of Life
    flowing there.
   And all manner of fruits
    for His wisdom to share.
   Oh, when shall I go o’er there?

*4.* There the thrones of the Lamb
    and the Father are found;
   From the height of Mount Zion
    they reign.
   From redemption’s firstfruits
    a new song doth resound.
   Oh, when shall I go o’er there?
