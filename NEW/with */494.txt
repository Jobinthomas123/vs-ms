*Chorus:*
   *x2*
     |9|         |2|
   Arise! Shine! For thy light
        |9|
    is come!


             |2|
   And the glory of the Lord
        |11|*m*
    is risen,
         |2|                   |11|*m*
   The glory of the Lord is come,
         |2|
   The glory of the Lord
        |11|*m*   |4|     |9|
    is risen upon thee!

  |2|           |4|
*1.* Awake, O church, put on
          |9|
    thy glory,
  |2|               |4|
   And clothe thyself
                 |9|
    in righteousness.
  |1|
   O let thy voice be heard
           |6|*m*
    throughout the whole earth;
 |11|*7*
   This is the hour
             |4|  |11|*7*   |4|
    of God’s saving grace!

*2.* Lift up the standard for all people;
   Restore the truth that once
    was lost.
   Build up the highway, now,
    of God’s holiness;
   Let vict’ry’s banner now
    be held up high.

*3.* These are the days of restoration,
   For out of Zion God has shined;
   Oh, do not rest from prayer
    till God’s work is done—
   Till all the church becomes
   His glorious bride.

*4.* Now when the Lord has built up Zion
   And filled Jerusalem with praise,
   In glory He’ll return
    and call unto thee,
   “Rise up, My love,
    and come away with Me!”
