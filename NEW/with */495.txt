 |0|      |7|       |9|*m—*|9|*m/*|7|
God is here with us,
    |5|
As certain as the air
       |7|       |0|      *—*|0|*7*
 that we are breathing.
    |5|                      |7|
As certain as the morning sun
   |4|*m*              |9|*7*
 arises day after day,
    |2|*m*
He promises He’ll never
  |7|
 leave us;
                  |0|
He’s with us to stay.
