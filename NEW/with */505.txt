|4|               |9|       |6|*m*
 My soul escaped like a bird
|11|                        |4|
 Out of the snare of the fowler.


*x2*
      |9|        |6|*m*
The snare is broken,
     |4|         |1|*m*
 and we are escaped;
    |6|*m*
Our help is in
      |11|           |4|
 the name of the Lord.
