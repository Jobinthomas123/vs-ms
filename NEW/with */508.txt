*1.* Jesus is my Savior;
   |11|*7*
   I shall not be moved.

   In His love and favor,
   |4|
   I shall not be moved;
               |9|            |6|*m*
   Just like a tree that’s planted
            |4|*-*|1|*m*
    by the waters, Lord,
   |4|       |11|*7*      |4|
   I shall not be moved.

*Chorus:*
   |4|
   I shall not be,
   |11|*7*
   I shall not be moved.

   I shall not be,
   |4|
   I shall not be moved;
               |9|             |6|*m*
   Just like a tree that’s planted
            |4|*-*|1|*m*
    by the waters, Lord,
   |4|        |11|*7*     |4|
   I shall not be moved.

*2.* In my Christ abiding,
   I shall not be moved.
   In His love I’m hiding;
   I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that’s planted
    by the waters, Lord,
   I shall not be moved.

*3.* If I trust Him ever,
   I shall not be moved;
   He will fail me never,
   I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that’s planted
    by the waters, Lord,
   I shall not be moved.

*4.* On His Word I’m feeding;
   I shall not be moved.
   He’s the One that’s leading;
   I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that’s planted
    by the waters, Lord,
   I shall not be moved.
