          |2|
*1.* In my Lord there’s peace
         |7| *—* |4|*m*
    and safety
         |2|                 |9|
   As I walk in His sweet will;
         |2|     |2|*7*      |7| *—* |4|*m*
   If I give my all to Jesus,
            |2|         |9|    |2|
   I shall reach the Holy Hill.

*Chorus:*
            |2|
   Speak, O Master, speak to me;

   Speak, my soul doth thirst
          |9|
    for Thee.
            |2|       |2|*7*
   Lord, I want to be in
         |7| *——* |4|*m*
    the rapture,
             |2|          |9|       |2|
   When the saints are gathered in.

*2.* It’s the narrow way I’ve taken,
   In my pilgrim life on earth;
   Leaving all the world
    and pleasures,
   Seeking now Thy kingdom first.

*3.* Yoked together with my Jesus,
   I do satisfaction find;
   All my life, to Thee surrendered—
   Not my will, but only Thine.

*4.* Oh, the love of God to mortals,
   Human mind cannot conceive!
   Now with open heart I’m waiting,
   All Thy grace, Lord, to receive.

*5.* Keep me faithful in the battle,
   In the darkest hour of strife,
   As a shining light in darkness,
   Holding forth the Word of Life!

*6.* When I think of all the treasures
   Stored in heaven just for me;
   When I’m raptured  up to glory,
   I shall rule and reign with Thee.
