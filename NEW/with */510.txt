*1.* Well, I guess you’ve heard
           |2|*7*
    the story,
              |7|*7*            |2|
   How in the Bible it was told

   Of the three little Hebrew children
               |4|*7*             |9|*7*
   And all the idols made of gold,
           |2|
   How the evil king commanded
               |2|*7*
   That every knee
                   |7|
    should bow to Baal.

   They said, “Do what you must,
           |2|
    we’ll put our trust
          |9|*7*               |2|
   In the God that cannot fail!”


*Chorus:*
   |2|*7*             |7|
   For He’s the great God Jehovah—
        |2|
   So greatly to be praised;

   He’s the God that’ll take us over
          |4|*7*              |9|*7*
   Every mountain sin has raised.
           |2|
   Out of all the gods men worship,
              |2|*7*                 |7|
   There’s a difference you can tell;

   He’s the only One
              |2|
    who ever gave His Son.
            |9|*7*               |2|
   He’s the God that cannot fail!


*2.* Now they were bound,
    and yet determined,
   As in the furnace they
    were thrown;
   But the king came
    and soon discovered
   They weren’t a-walkin’ in the
    fire alone.
   When he came up to the furnace,
   And he first looked over the rail,
   He saw Shadrach, Meshach,
    Abed-nego,
   And the God that cannot fail!


*3.* Well, the fourth Man
    in the furnace,
   He was the blessed Son of God;
   He had eyes like a flame of fire,
   His feet with burning brass
    they were shod.
   His face like the sun was shining.
   How His fire surely prevailed;
   What a glory was there,
    what a joy they shared
   With the God that cannot fail!
