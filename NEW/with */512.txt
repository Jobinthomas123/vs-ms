        |2|*m*                     |7|*m*
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord;
    |0|
My soul shall be joyful
        |2|*m*
 in my God.
    |2|*m*
For, He hath clothed me with
      |7|*m*
 the garments of salvation;
|9|
He has covered me with
                       |2|*m*
 the robe of righteousness.
