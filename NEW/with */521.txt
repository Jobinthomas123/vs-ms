If God now be for us,

 who can be against us?

If God now be for us,
                    |9|
 who shall then prevail?

If God now be for us,

 who can be against us?
   |7|*m*
If God now be for us,
  |9|               |2|*m*
 how can we then fail?

     |5|
The Lord goes before us,
                |0|
 marching into battle—
   |5|
A pillar of fire,
                    |0|
 a cloud of glory bright.
    |7|*m*
The foes are retreating,
      |5|
 the giants He’s beating;
     |4|                   |9|*4-*|9|
The Lord is our victory sure!
