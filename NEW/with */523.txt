*1.* What can wash away my sin?
                             |11|*7-*|4|
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

   What can make me whole again?
                             |11|*7-*|4|
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

*Chorus:*

   Oh! Precious is the flow
     |11|*7*                     |4|
   That makes me white as snow.

   No other fount I know,
                             |11|*7-*|4|
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

*2.* For my pardon this I see—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
   For my cleansing, this my plea—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

*3.* Nothing can for sin atone—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
   Naught of good that I have done—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

*4.* This is all my hope and peace—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
   This is all my righteousness—
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
