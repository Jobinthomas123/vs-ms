*Chorus:*
         |0|   |5|*m6*         |0|
   Holy Spirit, move in me;
                    |9|*m*
   Take my whole life and
            |2|*m7-*|7|
    let me be
           |0|              |5|*-*|2|*m7*
   Just a vessel all for Thee.
          |0|   |7|          |0|
   Holy Spirit, move in me.

           |2|*m7*      |7|
*1.* Take my life, O Lord,
               |0|*ma7*
    and please use me;
         |2|*m7*    |7|*7*           |0|
   Empty me of self and vanity.
                |5|    |5|*m*
   Cleanse and sanctify
             |0|
    by Thy Spirit;
           |2|
   Let the life of Christ
                |7|
    be seen in me.

*2.* Here am I, O Lord,
    so now send me
   To tell others
    of Thy wondrous love;
   In the harvest fields, I will labor.
   Grant me strength and wisdom
    from above.

*3.* As I journey, Lord,
    toward that city,
   I’ll employ my service
    all for Thee;
   By Your grace and love
    I’ll be faithful
   Till Thy face in glory I shall see.
