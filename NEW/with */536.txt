*1.* A wonderful Savior is Jesus
        |0|
    my Lord,
                |9|*m*       |2|*m7-*|7|
   A wonderful Savior to me;
       |0|         |0|*7*
   He hideth my soul
             |5|          |2|*m7*
    in the cleft of the rock,
          |0|          |7|         |0|
   Where rivers of pleasure I see.

*Chorus:*
       |7|
   He hideth my soul
             |5|           |0|
    in the cleft of the rock
         |2|*m7*       |7|            |0|
   That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
                |0|*7*
   He hideth my life
            |2|*m7*           |5|
    in the depths of His love
        |0|          |7|
   And covers me there
              |0|
    with His hand.
        |0|          |7|
   And covers me there
              |0|
    with His hand.

*2.* A wonderful Savior is Jesus
    my Lord;
   He taketh my burden away.
   He holdeth me up,
    and I shall not be moved;
   He giveth me strength as my day.

*3.* With numberless blessings
    each moment He crowns
   And filled with His
    fullness divine,
   I sing in my rapture,
    oh, glory to God
   For such a Redeemer as mine!

*4.* When clothed in His brightness,
    transported I rise
   To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
   His perfect salvation,
    His wonderful love,
   Iâ€™ll shout with the millions
    on high.
