Love, wonderful love,
                   |9|*7*
The love of God to me;

Love, wonderful love,
                       |2|
So rich, so full, so free;
                     |7|
Wide, as wide as the ocean,
 |4|*7*                   |9|
Deep, as deep as the sea,
 |2|
High, as high as the heavens
    |7|
  above,
     |2|   |9|*7* |2|
His love to me.
