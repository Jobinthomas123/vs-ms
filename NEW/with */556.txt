*Chorus:*
   *x2*
     |7|     |2|     |0|
   Thanks be to God
                          |2|
    Who leads us in His triumph.
     |7|    |2|      |0|
   Thanks be to God
                  |2|    |7|
    Who’s got the victory.


    |7|
*1.* We have overcome the world
     |2|
    by the blood of the Lamb;
    |0|
   We are loving not our lives
         |2|     |7|
    even unto death.

   The word of our testimony
   |2|
   Tells the world about His love,
   |0|
   As we shout unto the nations
          |2|      |7|
   He is coming back!
              |2|      |7|
   Oh, He is coming back!

*2.* Through the blood of our
    Redeemer
    we are free from the curse;
   Jesus is the one and only
    perfect sacrifice.
   He has conquered Satan’s power;
   No more shall we be ashamed.
   Just as He defeated death
   We shall never die,
   No, we shall never die!
