                 |7|
We’re together again,
                    |0|
 just praising the Lord.
                 |2|
We’re together again
           |7|
 in one accord.

Something good is
           |0|
 going to happen;
           |7|           |0|
Something good is in store.
                 |2|
We’re together again,
                    |7|
 just praisin’ the Lord!
