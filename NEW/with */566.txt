       |9|*m*            |4|*m*
*1.* As David did in Jehovah’s sight,
   |9|*m*                |4|*m*
   I will dance with all my might
     |7|                |9|*m*
   Before the King of kings!
       |9|*m*
   As Miriam did with the
      |4|*m*
    tambourine,
   |9|*m*             |4|*m*
   I will clap my hands and sing
     |7|                 |9|*m*
   Before the King of kings!

*Chorus:*
    |5|            |7|
   We can come before Him
         |5|             |9|*m*
    and worship Him today;
    |5|           |7|
   We can now adore Him—
    |5|              |9|*m*
    Jesus made the way!

*2.* As Judah did on the battle ground,
   We will make a joyful sound
   Before the King of kings!
   As Joshua did at Jericho,
   We will shout to defeat the foe
   Before the King of kings!
