    |4|*m*         |0|     |2|     |4|*m*
*1.* Sound the trumpet everywhere,
    |0|          |2|        |4|*m*
    all throughout the land.
           |0|     |2|        |4|*m*
   Follow My decrees you must;
      |0|         |11|*7*
    obey my commands.
    |9|*m*              |2|
   Gather with your families,
         |11|*7*                  |4|*m*
    come sing and clap your hands;
              |0|       |11|*7*   |0|
   It is the year of Jubilee.

*Chorus:*
             |4|*m*           |7|
   It is the Year of Jubilee,
            |9|*m*
   When the lame shall walk,
           |11|*7*
    and the blind shall see,
             |4|*m*
   When the Lord sets
         |9|*m*        |11|*7*
    the captives free.
             |4|*m*       |11|*7* |4|*m*
   It is the Year of Jubilee.

*2.* Sound the trumpet, Israel;
    let the people hear.
   It is I the Lord your God
    Who now draws you near;
   I have not forsaken you,
    so thereâ€™s no need to fear.
   It is the Year of Jubilee.

*3.* Sound the trumpet everywhere;
    let His praises ring.
   Yeshua has redeemed mankind;
    salvation He brings.
   By His precious sacrifice,
    we now are standing free.
   It is the Year of Jubilee.
