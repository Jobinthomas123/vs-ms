We’re a city not forsaken,
    |6|*m*                |11|
A city that can’t be shaken,
 |6|*m*             |11|*7*
Raised up high, high above,
  |4|
Guarded and protected
     |4|*7*
 by God’s own love;
    |9|         |6|*m*
A city sought after,
   |4|                       |1|*m*
A city that’s filled with laughter,
   |4|
A holy people
    |1|*m*
 redeemed of the Lord,
 |6|*m*                 |11|*-*|11|*7*   |4|
Standing together in one accord!
