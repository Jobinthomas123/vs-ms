            |7|
Lift up your countenance,

All ye saints of God;
           |9|*m*
Lift up your countenance,
         |2|          |2|*7*
For the victory is won.
            |7|
Lift up your countenance,

All ye saints of God,
               |9|*m*  |7|
And give the glo——ry
 |9|*m*      |2|*7*  |7|
 to the Holy One.

          |4|*m*
For, the battle has been won

Through the blood of

 God’s own Son,
        |7|
Who has walked

 from death to life;
        |4|*m*
And no more the gates of hell

Will against the church prevail,
          |7|           |2|
For He’s won the victory—
         |9|*m —* |2|*7*
 eternally.
