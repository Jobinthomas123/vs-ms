 Great and mighty is He!
   |7|                  |9|
 Great and mighty is He!

 Clothed in glory,
     |2|
  arrayed in splendor—
   |7|                 |9|
 Great and mighty is He!

|7|       |2|         |9|
 Let us lift His name up high,
|7|      |2|         |9|
 Celebrate His grace;
|7|       |2|      |9|
 For He has redeemed our lives
          |7|  *—*|4|*m*    |4|*7*
  and He reigns on high!
