*Chorus:*
            |2|
   Hear my cry, O Lord,
      |0|      |7|      |2|
   Attend unto my prayer;

   From the end of the earth
         |0|     |7|      |2|
    will I cry unto Thee.
                  |9|
   And, when my heart

    is overwhelmed
           |7|              |2|
   Please lead me to the Rock
                       |9|*—*|4|*m7—*|9|
   That is higher than I,
                       |2|
   That is higher than I.

*1.* Lord, in my distress I cried;
           |2|       |0|    |7|   |2|
   Lift me up and make me stand.
  |0|                  |7|
   Jesus, You’re my solid Rock;
           |9|        |4|*7*      |9|
   Other ground is sinking sand!


*2.* Come, O Lord, and fill my soul
   With a love for higher ground;
   Free my heart
    from earthly cares—
   Pressing on I’m heaven bound!

*3.* Lord, I know You’re coming soon;
   You’ll sweep me up
    to see Your face.
   Help me live above this world;
   Lead me upward by Your grace!
