*Chorus:*
      |2|         *—*|2|*7*    |7|         *—*|4|*m*
   Through it all,  through it all,
         |9|           |4|*m7*     |9|
   I’ve learned to trust in Jesus;
         |2|
   I’ve learned to trust in God.
     |2|          *—*|2|*7*    |7|         *—*|4|*m*
   Through it all,  through it all,
          |9|           |4|*m7*   |9|*4*
   I’ve learned to depend upon
    |9|*7*  |2|
   His Word.

       |2|
*1.* Now I’ve had many tears

    and sorrows,
    |2|*maj7*
   I’ve had questions for tomorrow;
     |9|*m*
   There’ve been times
       |2|*7*                      |7|
    I didn’t know right from wrong.
           |7|*m*
   But, in every situation
             |2|          |11|*7*
   God gave blessed consolation
            |4|*m7*
   That my trials come
       |9|               |2|
    to only make me strong.

*2.* Yes, I have lots of friends to go to
   In all the trials that I go through,
   There’ve been times
    I felt so all alone.
   But in my lonely hours,
    yes, those precious lonely hours,
   Jesus let me know that
    I’m His very own.

*3.* I thank God for the mountains,
   And I thank Him for the valleys;
   I thank Him for the storms
    He brought me through.
   For if I’d never had a problem,
   I wouldn’t know that
    He could solve them;
   I’d never know what
    faith in God could do.
