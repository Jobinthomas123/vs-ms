Rejoice in the Lord!
   |7|
Rejoice in the Lord;
 |2|
Lift up your hands
         |11|*7*
 in jubilation.
  |4|*m*
Rejoice in the Lord!
   |7|
Rejoice in the Lord;
   |2|            |11|*7*
Rejoice in the God
            |4|*m*
 of our salvation.

 |9|*m*           |4|*m*
Give Him the glory,
      |11|*7*        |4|*m*
 for He is our King;
 |9|*m*         |4|*m*
We are His peopleâ€”
      |11|*7*
 His praises we sing,

And again I say:
