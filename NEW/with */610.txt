*1.* Redeemed, how I love

    to proclaim it,
      |2|
   Redeemed by the blood
            |7|
    of the Lamb,
      |7|
   Redeemed through His

    infinite mercy,
         |2|                 |7|
   His child and forever I am.

*Chorus:*
      |0|         |7|
   Redeemed, redeemed,
      |2|
   Redeemed by the blood
            |7|
    of the Lamb,
      |0|*–*|9|*m*      |7|*-*|4|*m*
   Redeemed, redeemed,
       |9|*m/*|0|         |2|      |7|
   His child and forever I am.

*2.* Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
   No language my rapture can tell;
   I know that the light
    of His presence,
   With me doth continually dwell.

*3.* I think of my blessed Redeemer;
   I think of Him all the day long.
   I sing, for I cannot be silent;
   His love is the theme of my song.

*4.* I know I shall see in His beauty,
   The king in whose law I delight;
   Who lovingly guardeth
    my footsteps,
   And giveth me songs in the night.

*5.* I know there’s crown that
    is waiting
   In yonder bright mansion for me;
   And soon with the spirits
    made perfect,
   At home with the Lord I shall be.
