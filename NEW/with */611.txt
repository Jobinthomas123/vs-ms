*2.* Praise, praise Him for His grace,
    grace in time of need,
   He’s our Priest Who knows
    our nature frail;
   In path of trial oft,
    oh, His grace did lead.
   Took our pains on Him,
    and our sickness all did heal.

*3.* Bless, bless His holy name
    for His kindness great,
   And His gifts He graciously
    loads us with.
   He keeps us day by day
    by His love and might.
   He’s our Hiding Place;
   He’s our Rock and Shield
    and Strength.

*4.* Hail, hail Him Lord and King;
    soon He shall appear
   For His church, His bride,
    arrayed in white.
   He’ll rule from holy Zion;
    saints His kingdom share
   From Jerusalem, holy city,
    fair and bright.

*5.* Praise, praise Him night and day,
    all ye sons of Zion.
   Serve Him in fear and purity,
    filled with grace.
   His glory we would share
    soon there on His throne;
   Clothed in garment bright,
    praising we shall see His face.
