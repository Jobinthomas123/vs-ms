*1.* I need You, Lord,

   More than the air that
          |11|*m*   *[Note:* |11| |10| |3|*]*
    I’m breathing.
   |4|*m*
   I need Your touch,
                         |9|*-*|9|*4-*|9|
    more than riches or fame.
            |6|*m*         |7|
   For, I know where I come from,
          |6|*m*             |7|
   And I see what You’ve done.
       |7|*/*|6|  |7|*/*|4|*m-*|7|*/*|2|
   Could I   ev— er stop
      |0|               |9|*4/*|9|
    praising You, my King?

*2.* I could not see
   That I was lost
    and without hope—
   Carried away by my heart,
    by my thoughts.
   At the cross, where You led me,
   With Your blood shed for me,
   You have washed,
    You have rolled my sins away.

*3.* A cry in the night,
   An outstretched hand
    looking for help,
   An aimless life, without love,
    without strength,
   So was I, when You found me,
   Out of hell, rescued me.
   Now I know You’re the Savior
    of my life.

*4.* I need Your Word
   More than the food
    that sustains me.
   I find in You,
    that my life’s satisfied.
   Yet, if I lose my way,
   And if I go astray,
   You’re my light
    and You lead me on again.

*5.* With all my strength,
   With all my heart will I love You.
   Now, Lord, I pray,
    keep me faithful and true.
   All my days, I will serve You
   As I’m waiting for You.
   Make me ready,
    my soon and coming King.

*Ending:*
   |2|
   I need You, Lord.
