      |4|             |11|     |4|
*1.* I came to Him in dire need;
       |9|      |11|          |4| *–* |4|*7*
   My life I could not change.
          |9|     |11|       |4|
   And, when I saw His mercy so
      |1|*m*
    great,
      |6|              |11|
   In love to Him I clave.

   Sufficient was His grace to me;
   He never let me down.
   I was so happy in His work—
   His strength for labor found.

*Chorus:*
      |9|         |11|    |4|        |1|*m*
   Oh, I could never live without
        |9|     |11|       |4| *–* |4|*7*
    my Savior and my King,
       |9|       |11|         |4|       |1|*m*
   And I will serve Him till the end
          |6|*m7*     |11|       |4|
    for what He’s done for me.

*2.* After some time of serving Him,
   My heart began to doubt;
   I did not know which road to take,
   And to Him I cried out.

   Oh, once again,
    please save me, Lord!
   Deliver me from sin!
   And once again, His loving hand,
   In mercy took me in.

*3.* A God of restoration, He
   Restored that which was lost;
   And brought me back into
    first love,
   But bid me count the cost.

   I said, dear Lord,
    please pierce my ear;
   I’ve seen Your faithfulness.
   I never want to leave your side;
   I’ll serve You till the end.

*4.* My life’s now bound
    by love’s strong cords;
   I never can go free.
   To Him forever I belong,
   And He belongs to me.

   Oh, soon I know I’ll see His face;
   My fiery trials will pass,
   And so till then I’ll seek His grace,
   Till with Him safe at last.

*(Spanish Chorus)*

   Oh, nunca yo podré vivir
    sin mi gran Salvador;
   Le serviré por siempre jamás
   por mostrarme Su amor.
