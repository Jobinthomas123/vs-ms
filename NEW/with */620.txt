O Lord, You are my Refuge and
    |4|
 Strength;
                     |9|        |11|
I run to You and I know I am safe.
              |9|           |4|
Youâ€™re everywhere all the time.
             |9|             |4|
You hear my voice when I cry,
        |4|          |1|*m*     |9|
And You run to my rescue again
 |11|     |4|
 and again.
