|4|  |9|               |11|
I come to do Your will,
         |4| *–* |1|*m*
 oh, my God.
      |9|             |11|
Your law is written on
     |4| *–* |1|*m*
 my heart.
       |9|          |11|
You’ve opened my ears;
      |4|          |1|*m*
Your call I now hear.
   |9|               |11|
I come to do Your will,
         |4|
 oh, my God.

Spirit, soul and body I give.
Only for Your glory I’ll live.
Be it gain or loss,
Be it crown or cross,
I come to do Your will,
 oh, my God.
