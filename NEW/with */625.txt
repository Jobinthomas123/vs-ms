      |2|
*1.* A life poured out
            |11|*m7*         *—*|2|*ma7*
    at the Master’s feet;
       |2|               |11|*m7*
   Forsaking all, His fields
          *—*|2|*maj7*
    to reap;
       |2|                 |7|
   And if with tears we sow,
         |9|                  |2|
   The seeds of love will grow—
            |7|      |9|
   We must go and give
                   |2|*—*|2|*7*
    our lives for souls.

*Chorus:*
    |7|         |9|
   We have received so much
          |2|*—*|11|*m*
    from Him.
               |4|*m7*
   How can we hold it back,
      |9|            |2|
   Denying men of life,
                    |2|*7*
    their souls to win?
        |7|              |9|
   Oh, Jesus gave His life
          |2|            |11|*m*
    as a willing sacrifice,
       |7|     |9|        |2|    |11|
   To rescue all the perishing
               |7|      |9|        |2|
   From their broken lives of sin.


*2.* See them grope in obscurity—
   Blindly led by empty dreams.
   But if we dare believe,
   Great glory we shall see;
   For with joy we’ll gather
    in the sheaves.

*3.* Our cups are full;
    we’re satisfied.
   Our blood-stained hands
    we cannot hide;
   But Christ was crucified,
   That these may be His bride.
   Let’s arise and work before
    the night.

*Last Chorus:*
   We have received so much
    from Him.
   How can we hold it back,
   Denying men of life,
    their souls to win?
   Oh, we must give our lives
    as a willing sacrifice
   To rescue, now, the perishing
   From their broken lives of sin.
   Let’s rescue all,
    the great and small,
   Rememb’ring where we’ve been.
