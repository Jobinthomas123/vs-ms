*1.* My Jesus, I love Thee;
        |4|*m*   |9|       |2|
    I know Thou art mine.
            |7|        |2|   |11|*m*
   For thee all the pleasures
        |4|*m*  |9|   |2|
    of sin  I resign.

   My gracious Redeemer,
       |2|  |7|         |9| *—*|9|*7*
    my Savior art Thou;
     |2|  |7|     |2|      |11|*m*
   If ever I loved Thee,
        |4|*m-*|9|        |2|
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!

*2.* I love Thee because
   Thou has first loved me,
   And purchased my pardon
    on Calvary’s tree;
   I love Thee for wearing
    the thorns on Thy brow.
   If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!

*3.* I’ll love Thee in life;
   I will love Thee in death,
   And praise Thee as long as Thou
    lendest me breath.
   And say, should the death-dew
    lie cold on my brow,
   If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!

*4.* In mansions of glory
   And endless delight,
   I’ll ever adore Thee
    in heaven so bright;
   I’ll sing with the glittering
    crown on my brow.
   If ever I loved Thee,
    my Jesus, ‘tis now!
