  |4|*m*
Arise, O people of God,
         |11|*7*
When the enemy is coming
    |4|*m*
 against you;
     |9|*m*
Take hold of the shield
           |4|*m*
 and the sword,
          |6|
And be strong.
                  |11|*7*
The Lord is with You.

|9|*m*             |4|*m*
He will never leave you;
     |11|*7*           |4|*m*    |4|*7*
His power He has given you.
|9|*m*             |4|*m*
He will not forsake you;
            |11|*7*             |4|*m*
What Heâ€™s promised He will do.
