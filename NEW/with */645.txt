*1.* I’m singing this song to thank You
       |7|                   |0|
   For all You’ve done for me.
        |9|*m*                   |2|*m*
   Oft’ times when I think about

    Your mercy,
          |5|
   There wells up in my heart
           |7|
    a melody
        |0|               |5|
   Of gratefulness to You, Lord,
        |7|              |0|
   For saving me from sin;
       |9|*m*
   A thousand tongues
           |2|*m*
    could never tell
       |5|      |7|      |0|*—*|0|*7*
   The joy I have within.

*Chorus #1:*
             |5|                   |0|
   You’re a wonderful Savior to me,
             |5|
   My dear Friend,
            |7|           |0|
   Yet the King of all kings.
              |5|         |7|
   You poured out Your life
          |0|    |9|*m*
    as a sacrifice,
              |5|
   That from sin,
        |7|             |0|
    we might be set free.

*2.* Some people say
    they’re too young now
   To waste their life in God,
   But real life is granted to us
   By the Father up above,
   Through Christ, His Son.
   And, if we know the Savior,
   He says we’ll never die.
   Be born again, trust in His blood,
   And have eternal life.

*Chorus #2:*
   He’s a wonderful Savior to me,
   My dear Friend,
   Yet the King of all kings.
   He poured out His life
    as a sacrifice,
   That from sin,
    we might be set free.

*3.* So, whether we’re old
    or young now,
   The time is near at hand,
   When Jesus is going to return
   To take His people
    to that glorious land.
   The days are passing quickly;
   The signs are very clear,
   And soon to all who look for Him
   Our Bridegroom will appear.

*Chorus #3:*
   My Beloved, I’m waiting for Him;
   In His presence forever I’ll sing.
   On His throne of grace,
   I shall see His face—
   Spotless Lamb,
   The King of all kings.
