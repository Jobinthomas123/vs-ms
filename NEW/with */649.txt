*1.* My faith has found a resting place,
       |2|               |7|
   Not in device nor creed.
               |7|*7*  |0|      |9|*m*
   I trust the Everliving One;
        |2|                    |7|
   His wounds for me shall plead.

*Chorus:*
   |7|               |2|
   I need no other argument;
       |4|*m*     |0|      |2|*4 —*|2|
   I need no other plea.
   |2|*7*  |7|    |7|*7*         |0|     |9|*m*
   It  is enough that Jesus died
         |2|      |2|*4*   |2|*7*  |7|
   And that He died for me.

*2.* Enough for me that Jesus saves,
   This ends my fear and doubt.
   A sinful soul I come to Him;
   He’ll never cast me out.

*3.* My heart is leaning on the Word,
   The written Word of God—
   Salvation by my Savior’s name,
   Salvation through His blood.

*4.* My great Physician heals the sick;
   The lost He came to save.
   For me His precious blood
    He shed;
   For me His life He gave.
