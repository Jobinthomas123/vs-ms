God is the Lord
      |7|            |0|
Who shows us the light;
                  |5|
Strong is loveâ€™s cord
    |7|*4*       |7|    |0|
To bind the sacrifice. *x2*

To the horns of the altar
        |5|         |0|
With Christ crucified,

His beauty for ashes
       |7|        |0|
When there we abide. *x2*
