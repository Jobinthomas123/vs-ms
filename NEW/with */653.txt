*1.* Oh, how well I remember

   In the old-fashioned days,
             |5|               |0|
   When some old-fashioned people
            |2|*/*|6|           |7|
   Had some old-fashioned ways.
          |0|
   In the old-fashioned meetings
                     |5|
   As they tarried there,
          |0|              |9|*m*
   In the old-fashioned manner,
           |2|*m*     *—*|7|         |0|
   How God answered  their prayer.

*Chorus:*
      |0|
   ‘Twas an old-fashioned meeting

   In an old-fashioned place,
                              |9|*m*
   Where some old-fashioned people
            |2|*/*|6|            |7|
   Had some old-fashioned grace;
         |0|
   As an old-fashioned sinner
           |0|*7*  |5|
   I began to pray,
             |0|          |9|*m*
   And God heard me and saved me
          |2|*m*   |7|         |0|
   In the old-fashioned way.

*2.* There was singing, such singing
   Of those old-fashioned airs!
   There was power, such power
   In those old-fashioned prayers!
   An old-fashioned conviction
   Made the sinner pray,
   And the Lord heard
    and saved him,
   In the old-fashioned way.

*3.* Well, they say it is better,
   “Things have changed,
    don’t you know,”
   And the people in gen’ral,
   Seem to think it is so;
   And they call me old-fashioned
   When I dare to say,
   That I like it far better
   In the old-fashioned way.

*4.* If the Lord never changes,
   As the fashions of men,
   If He’s always the same,
   Why, He is old-fashioned then!
   As an old-fashioned sinner
   Saved through old-time grace,
   Oh, I’m sure He will take me
   To an old-fashioned place.
