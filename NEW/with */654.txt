*Chorus:*
   *x2*
    |4|
   Go forth!
                       |11|
   I’ve given you the victory.

   Go forth!
                    |4|
   The enemy must flee. *x2*

       |4|
*1.* The Israelites were held as slaves
                       |11|
   By Pharoah and his host,

   But when they cried unto the Lord,
       |11|*7*                 |4|
   He hearkened to their voice.
          |4|
   Oh, free at last till the Red Sea,
                            |11|
   Where Pharoah, he drew near;

   But Moses cried unto the Lord,
         |11|*7*           |4|
   God spoke into his ear.

   He said:

*2.* God led them to Mt. Sinai;
   A mighty host were they.
   His glory dwelt within their midst
   To guide them all the way.
   The Jordan River, deep and wide,
   He led them to one day;
   “Go step by step, be not afraid,
   I’ll lead you all the way.”
   He said:

*3.* At Jericho they stood in awe;
   Its walls reached to the sky.
   His word was march,
    and that they did;
   Those walls came tumbling down.
   Now many mountains
    there may be
   Before your path today;
   Take heart, O saints!
    Go forth in faith!
   He’ll lead you all the way.
   He says:

*Last Chorus:*
   *x2*
   Go forth!
   I’ve given you the victory;
   Go forth!
   The enemy must flee. *x2*

*Ending:*
   And we’ll … Go forth!
   He’s given us the victory!
   Go forth!
   The enemy must flee!
