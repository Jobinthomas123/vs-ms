*1.* When pangs of death

    seized on my soul,
      |7|      |5|   |7|*7*  |0|
   Unto the Lord I cried.
                        |9|*m*
   Till Jesus came and made

    me whole,
      |2|*m*        |7|*7*    |0|
   I would not be denied.

*Chorus:*
                     |0|*7*
   I would not be denied.
      |5|        |2|*m*    |0|
   I would not be denied.
                        |9|*m*
   Till Jesus came and made

    me whole,
      |2|*m*       |7|*7*    |0|
   I would not be denied.

*2.* As Jacob in the days of old,
   I wrestled with the Lord;
   And instant, with a courage bold,
   I stood upon His word.

*3.* Old Satan said my Lord was gone,
   And would not hear my prayâ€™r,
   But, praise the Lord!
    The work is done,
   And Christ the Lord is here.
