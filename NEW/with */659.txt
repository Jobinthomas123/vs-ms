     |2|*m*
The Day of Christ shall come,
       |0|           |9|
Shall come, shall come.
     |2|*m*
The Day of Christ shall come,
       |0|           |9|
Shall come, shall come.
     |2|*m*
The Day of Christ shall come,
    |0|           *—*|9|
So watch and pray
              |2|*m*
for it shall come.

      |0|
Then Jesus shall descend
      |2|*m*
From heaven with a shout,
          |0|
With the voice of an archangel
|2|*m*
And the trump of God!

We’ll rise together in the clouds
   |7|*m*    |9|             |2|*m*
Forevermore with the Lord.

       |0|
Then those dead in Christ
         |2|*m*
shall arise!
     |0|                        |2|*m*
And we who are alive shall arise!

Caught up together in the clouds—
   |7|*m*    |9|              |2|*m*
Forevermore with the Lord.
