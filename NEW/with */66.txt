  Something beautiful,

   Something good,
|4|*m7*                    |9|
  All my confusion
  |2|        |2|*7*
   He understood.

  All I had to offer Him
         |2|              |11|*m*
   was brokenness and strife,
      |4|*m7*      |2|
  And He made something
    |9|                   |2|
   beautiful out of my life.
