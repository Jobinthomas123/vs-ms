I’m getting ready
     |9|      |11|   |4|
 to leave this world;
|4|            |1|m
I’m getting ready for
      |6|       |11|
 the gates of pearl!

Keeping my garments white,
 |1|*m*
Watching both day and night,
  |4|          |1|*m*
I’m getting ready
    |6|*m*     |11|   |4|
 to leave this world!
