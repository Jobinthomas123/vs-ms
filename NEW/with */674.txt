Jesus, draw me close,
    |4|*m*      |2|        |9|
 closer, Lord, to You;
 |2|       |9|*/*|1|   |11|*m*
Let the world around me
   |4|*m*  |2| |9|
 fade away.
 |2|      |9|*/*|1|     |11|*m*
Jesus, draw me close,
   |4|*m*      |2|        |9|
 closer, Lord, to You,
     |7|    |9|          |11|*m*
For my desire is to worship
  |9|    |7|*-*|2|
 and obey.
