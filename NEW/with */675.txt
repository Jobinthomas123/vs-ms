*1.* I hear the sound
          |9|
    of  abundance of  rain;
    |7|
   Bright clouds around
         |9|
    are forming.
    |2|
   Touch me again;
         |9|
    I’ll never be the same.
    |7|                 |9| |2|
   Grant us fresh outpouring!

*Chorus:*
   |2|           |7|   |9|
   Times of refreshing,
      |2|         |7|  |9|
    showers of blessing—
   |9|         |7| |9|
   Open the windows
       |9|*7*      |2|
    of heaven wide!
   |2|           |7| |9|
   Holy Ghost power
    |2|              |7|*-*|9|
    for this last hour—
    |9|         |7|     |2|     |9| |2|
   Lord, all Your church revive!

*2.* I hear the sound of
    a rushing, mighty wind;
   Deep in my heart it’s blowing.
   Sweep o’er my soul
    and change my life within.
   Fill us to overflowing!

*3.* I hear the voice
    of my Savior calling me:
   My child, for you I’m coming;
   What I’ve begun
    I promise to complete—
   First love and faith restoring!
