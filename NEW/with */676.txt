  |9|           |6|*m7*
Shut in with God
         |2|       |4|
 in the secret place,
  |4|*7*
There in the Spirit
    |2|  |4|    |4|*7*  |9|
 beholding His face.
 |9|           |2|
Gaining new power
    |1|*m*            |6|*m7*
 to run in lifeâ€™s race,
   |4|          |4|*7*
I long to be shut in
       |9|
 with God.
