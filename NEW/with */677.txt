*Chorus:*
     |0|     |7|
   Who is like You,
     |5|       |0|
    Lord my God,
    |5|         |7|
   Among the gods,
            |0|      *-*|7|
    who is like You?
     |0|          |7|
   Glorious in holiness,
    |5|              |0|
   Fearful in all praises,
        |5|           |7|
   And doing great wonders,
    |7|           |7|*7* |0|
   Doing great wonders!

        |0|            |7|
*1.* The Lord is my strength
           |5|          |0|
    and become my salvation;
       |5|        |7|
   Oh, He is my God.
            |0|       *-*|7|
   I will exalt Him!
        |0|         |7|
   The Lord is a man of war,
   |5|          |0|
   Mighty in power;
       |5|                |7|
   His right hand will crush
   |5|      |7|   |0|
   All my enemies!

*2.* The army of Pharoah,
    the chariots and horses,
   Were cast in the sea—
    what a victory!
   We’ll dance and rejoice in Him,
   Shout hallelujah!
   We have been set free—
    glorious liberty!

*3.* The enemy comes
    to devour Your people,
   But You stretch Your hand
    out to destroy him!
   Your greatness and majesty
   Scatter his forces;
   You reign, O Most High,
    now and evermore!
