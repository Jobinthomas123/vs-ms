       |4|                    |11|
*1.* In tenderness He sought me,
                        |4|
   Weary and sick with sin.

   And on His shoulders
       |9|
    brought me
         |11|      |6|*7*   |11|
   Back to His fold again,
         |11|*7*     |4|
   While angels in His
      |11|       |4|
    presence sang,
     |6|                 |11|  |6|  |11|*-*|11|*7*
   Until the courts of heaven rang.

*Chorus:*
   |4|                         |11|
   Oh, the love that sought me!
   |11|*7*                         |4|
   Oh, the blood that bought me!
                        |11|
   Oh, the grace that brought me
     |4|      |11|
    to the fold,
    |4|         |9|          |4|
   Wondrous grace that brought me
     |11|      |4|
    to the fold!

*2.* He washed the bleeding
    sin-wounds
   And poured in oil and wine;
   He whispered to assure me,
   “I’ve found thee, thou art Mine”.
   I never heard a sweeter voice;
   It made my aching heart rejoice!

*3.* He pointed to the nail-prints,
   For me His blood was shed.
   A mocking crown so thorny,
   Was placed upon His head;
   I wondered what He saw in me,
   To suffer such deep agony.

*4.* I’m sitting in His presence,
   The sunshine of His face,
   While with adoring wonder
   His blessings I retrace.
   It seems as if eternal days
   Are far too short
    to sound His praise.

*5.* So, while the hours are passing,
   All now is perfect rest;
   I’m waiting for the morning,
   The brightest and the best,
   When He will call us to His side,
   To be with Him,
   His spotless bride.
