*1.* O Jesus, I have promised
       |5|          |7| |7|*7*  |0|
   To serve Thee to the end;
        |0|    |0|*7/*|4|  |5|    |2|*m*
   Be Thou forever near me,
       |7|     |0|       |7|*-*|7|*7*
   My Master and my Friend.
       |0|                 |5|   |0|
   I shall not fear the battle
        |0|        |0|*7/*|4| |5|*-*|2|*m*
   If Thou art by my side,
        |0|               |7|   |7|*7*
   Nor wander from the pathway
        |5|        |7| |7|*7*  |0|
   If Thou wilt be my Guide.

*2.* Oh, let me feel Thee near me;
   The world is ever near.
   I see the sights that dazzle;
   The tempting sounds I hear.
   My foes are ever near me—
   Around me and within;
   But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
   And shield my soul from sin.

*3.* Oh, let me hear Thee speaking
   In accents clear and still,
   Above the storms of passion,
   The murmurs of self-will.
   Oh, speak to reassure me,
   To hasten or control;
   Oh, speak and make me listen,
   Thou Guardian of my soul.

*4.* O Jesus, Thou hast promised
   To all who follow Thee,
   That where Thou art in glory
   There shall Thy servants be.
   And Jesus, I have promised
   To serve Thee to the end;
   Oh, give me grace to follow
   My Master and my Friend.

*5.* Oh, let me see Thy footprints,
   And in them plant my own;
   My hope to follow fully
   Is in Thy strength alone.
   Oh, guide me, call me, draw me,
   Uphold me to the end;
   And then in heav’n receive me,
   My Savior and my Friend.
