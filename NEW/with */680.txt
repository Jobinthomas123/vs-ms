*1.* Crown Him with many crowns—
        |0|     |5|         |7|
   The Lamb upon His throne.

   Hark! How the heavenly
     |2|        |7|
    anthem drowns
        |2|    |2|*7*      |7|
   All music but its own.
     |0|                 |5|
   Awake, my soul, and sing
      |2|                  |7|
   Of Him Who died for thee,
        |0|       |5|
   And hail Him as
        |7|         |0|
   Thy matchless King
           |5|    |7|    |0|
   Through all eternity.

*2.* Crown Him the Lord of life,
   Who triumped o’er the grave,
   And rose victorious in the strife
   For those He came to save.
   His glories now we sing
   Who died, and rose on high,
   Who died eternal life to bring,
   And lives that death may die.

*3.* Crown Him the Lord of peace,
   Whose power a scepter sways,
   From pole to pole,
    that wars may cease
   And all be prayer and praise.
   His reign shall know no end,
   And round His pierced feet,
   Fair flowers of paradise extend
   Their fragrance ever sweet.

*4.* Crown Him the Lord of love;
   Behold His hands and side.
   Those wounds, yet visible above,
   In beauty glorified.
   All hail, Redeemer, hail,
   For Thou hast died for me;
   Thy praise and glory shall not fail
   Throughout eternity.
