1. He healeth me — O blessed truth.
        |0|      |9|*m*     |0|
   His mighty Word renews
        |7|*7*
    my youth.
       |0|       |0|*7*
   By His own power,
          |5|         |2|*m*
    from sickness free,
        |0|       |9|*m*     |0|  |7|    |0|
   My precious Savior healeth me.

*Chorus:*
       |0|      |7|
   He healeth me.
        |5|       |0|
    He healeth me.
    |5|  |0|       |9|*m*
   By His own Word
        |0|      |7|*7*
    He healeth me;
        |0|        |7|*7*     |5|        |0|
   His faithful witness I would be,
    |5|   |0|      |9|*m*
   For by His Word
         |0| |7|    |0|
    He healeth me.

*2.* Sometimes through testing
    times I go,
   Dark seems the way,
    and full of woe;
   But in the furnace though I be,
   My great Physician healeth me.

*3.* Lord, I would spread this
    truth abroad—
   The mighty power of Thy Word;
   It’s just the same,
    the blind now see,
   And demons at Thy presence flee.

*4.* For sin and sickness doth depart,
   When Thou dost reign
    within the heart;
   And I from all the curse am free,
   Since Christ, my Savior,
    healeth me.
