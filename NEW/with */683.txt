*1.* Face to face with Christ
       |9|*m-*|2|*7*
    my Savior,
   |2|                         |7|
   Face to face what will it be?
              |0|
   When with rapture
     |7|   |9|*m*   |0|
    I behold Him,
   |9|*m*      |7|        |2|*7*       |7|
   Jesus Christ who died for me.

*Chorus:*
    |2|*7*                   |7|
   Face to face shall I behold Him,
    |2|     |9|        |9|*7*      |2|*-*|2|*7*
   Far beyond the starry sky;
    |7|      |7|*7*                |0|*-*|9|*m*
   Face to face in all His glory,
           |7|         |2|*7*    |7|
   I shall see Him by and by!

*2.* Only faintly now I see Him,
   With the darkling veil between.
   But a blessed day is coming
   When His glory shall be seen.

*3.* What rejoicing in His presence,
   When are banished grief and pain,
   When the crooked ways
    are straightened
   And the dark things shall be plain.

*4.* Face to face—O blissful moment!
   Face to face—to see and know!
   Face to face with my Redeemer,
   Jesus Christ Who loves me so.
