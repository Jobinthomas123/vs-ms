 |2| |2|*7*   |7|     |9|*/*|7|
I was born to be
      |2|*/*|6|    |11|*m*
 Thy dwelling place,
   |4|*m7*           |9|
A home for the presence
          |2|*â€”*|2|*7*
 of the Lord;
         |7|          |9|*/*|7|
May my heart always be
       |2|*/*|6|   |9|*/*|1|      |11|*m7*
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
           |4|*m7*
That I may be
             |9|*-*|9|*7*   |2|
 what I was born to be.
