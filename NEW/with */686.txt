*1.* O sacred head, now wounded,
    |4|   |9|*m*          |4|*7*
   With grief and shame
             |9|*m*
    weighed down,
         |5|    |2|*m*       |7|  |0|
   Now scornfully surrounded
    |4|     |9|*m*       |4|*7*    |9|*m*
   With thorns Thy only crown.
       |7|         |5|
   How art Thou pale with
     |0|*4* |0|
    anguish,
         |5|     |2|*m*        |9|
   With sore abuse and scorn!
    |2|*7*  |7|         |0|      |2|   |7|
   How does that visage languish
     |0|   |5|         |7|         |0|
   Which once was bright as morn!

*2.* What Thou, my Lord, hast
    suffered
   Was all for sinner’s gain;
   Mine, mine was the transgression,
   But Thine the deadly pain.
   Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
   ‘Tis I deserve Thy place.
   Look on me with Thy favor;
   Entrust me to Thy grace.

*3.* What language shall I borrow
   To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
   For this Thy dying sorrow,
   Thy pity without end?
   O make me Thine forever;
   And should I fainting be,
   Lord, let me never, never
   Outlive my love for Thee!
