1. More love to Thee, O Christ,
      |7|            |9|*m7-*|2|
    more love to Thee!
    |7|    |0|*/*|7|       |7|      |4|*m*
   Hear Thou the prayer I make
    |9|*m*  |0|*/*|2| |2|   |7|
    on bended knee;
     |0|                 |7|
   This is my earnest plea:
     |2|            |9|*m*         |7|
    more love, O Christ, to Thee.
    |0|             |7|
   More love to Thee,
    |9|*m7*    |2|       |7|
    more love to Thee!

*2.* Once earthly joy I craved,
    sought peace and rest.
   Now Thee alone I seek;
    give what is best.
   This all my prayer shall be:
    more love, O Christ to Thee.
   More love to Thee,
    more love to Thee!

*3.* Let sorrow do its work;
    send grief and pain.
   Sweet are Thy messengers;
    sweet their refrain,
   When they can sing with me,
    more love, O Christ to Thee,
   More love to Thee,
    more love to Thee!

*4.* Then shall my latest breath
    whisper Thy praise;
   This be the parting cry
    my heart shall raise;
   This still its prayer shall be:
    more love, O Christ, to Thee,
   More love to Thee,
    more love to Thee!
