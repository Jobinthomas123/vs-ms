         |0|          |0|*7*
*1.* When peace like a river
      |2|*m*  |7|       |0|
    attendeth my way,
         |9|*m*          |2|*7*
   When sorrows like sea
            |7| *–* |7|*7*
    billows roll,
       |0|      |5|
   Whatever my lot, Thou hast
     |2|*7*          |7|
    taught me to say,
   |5|     |0|*/*|4|         |0|*/*|7|
   It is well, it is well
     |7|       |0|
    with my soul.

*Chorus:*
          |7|
   It is well (it is well)
                          |0|
   With my soul (with my soul).
          |5|          |0|*/*|7|
   It is well, it is well
     |7|       |0|
    with my soul.

*2.* Though Satan should buffet,
    tho’ trials should come,
   Let this blest assurance control,
   That Christ has regarded my
    helpless estate,
   And hath shed His own
    blood for my soul.

*3.* My sin, oh, the bliss of this
    glorious tho’t—
   My sin, not in part, but the whole
   Is nailed to the cross and I
    bear it no more.
   Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    O my soul!

*4.* And, Lord, haste the day when
    my faith shall be sight,
   The clouds be roll’d back
    as a scroll.
   The trump shall resound,
    and the Lord shall descend,
   Even so, it is well with my soul.
