1. There is peace and contentment
            |5|       |5|*m6*      |0|
    in the Father’s house today.
              |0|         |9|*m7*
   Abundant food on the table
         |2|*m*                |7|
    and no one is turned away.
             |0|           |0|*7*
   There is singing and laughter
            |5|    |0|*/*|4|  |2|*m*
    as the hours pass by;
           |0|*/*|7|            |9|*m*
   Then a hush calms the singing
            |2|*m7*       |7|       |0|
    at the Father’s mournful cry:

*Chorus:*
   |0|           |5|
   My house is full,
         |0|           |9|*m*
    but My field is empty.
    |0|               |9|*m7*
   Who will go and work
              |2|*m7*  |7|
    for Me today?
         |0|                 |5|
   My children, hear the cry
         |0|                 |9|*m*
    of a million precious souls.
    |0|               |2|*m7*   |7|
   Who will go and show them
         |4|*7*   |9|*m7*
    the Way?
 |5|*m7* |0|               |2|*m7* |2|*m7/*|7|
   Who will go and show them
          |0|
    the Way?

*2.* Lift your eyes from the table;
    look out through the
    windowpane.
   Just beyond this house of plenty
    lies a field of golden grain.
   It is ripened unto harvest;
    but the reapers, where are they?
   In the house—oh, can’t the
    children
    hear the Father sadly say:

*3.* Many hopeless souls are crying.
   Who will go and win the lost?
   Soon the harvest will be over.
   Will you quickly count the cost?
   Will your life be dry and barren?
   Will you hang your head in
    shame?
   As a million souls are dying
   With no knowledge of My name.

*4.* You have just one life,
    My children;
   That so soon will pass away.
   When you stand here in
    My presence,
   Oh, what will you ever say?
   Have you lived for your own
    pleasure?
   Will your gain be turned to loss?
   Can’t you see the crown of glory?
   Won’t you now take up your
    cross?

*5.* Come, forsake your all,
    My children;
   Bear your cross and follow Me.
   I have shown you life eternal;
   From this present darkness flee.
   Lay a hold upon the glory;
   Come and follow in My way
   Then I’ll own you as My servants
   In that bright, eternal day.
