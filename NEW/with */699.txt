*1.* When I survey
    |9|*-*|11|  |4|*m*   |9|*7*   |2|
    the wondrous cross,
                  |2|*4*   |2|    |11|*m*   |9|
   On which the Prince of glory died,
   |2|              |9|*-*|11| |4|*m*    |9|*7*   |2|
   My richest gain I count but loss,
    |11|*m*          |6|*m*
   And pour contempt
    |11|*m*   |4|*m*    |9|*7*    |2|
    on   all   my pride.

*2.* Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
   Save in the death of Christ
    my God;
   All the vain things that charm
    me most,
   I sacrifice them to His blood.

*3.* See, from His head,
    His hands, His feet,
   Sorrow and love flow
    mingled down.
   Did eâ€™er such love
    and sorrow meet,
   Or thorns compose so rich
    a crown?

*4.* Were the whole realm of
    nature mine,
   That were a present far too small;
   Love so amazing, so divine,
   Demands my soul, my life, my all.
