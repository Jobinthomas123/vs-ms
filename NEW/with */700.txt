*1.* My heart  was distressed ‘neath

    Jehovah’s dread frown.
         |5|          |0|
   And, low in the pit where my
     |7|               |7|*7*
    sins dragged me down
       |0|
   I cried to the Lord from the
     |5|    |0|*/*|4|   |2|*m*
    deep miry clay,
        |0|
   Who tenderly brought me
    |2|*7*     |7|   |7|*7*  |0|
    out to golden day.

*Chorus:*
   |0|             |5|*/*|0|         |0|
   He brought me out of the miry clay;
   |9|*m*                     |7|   |2|  |7|*-*|7|*7*
   He set my feet on the Rock to stay.
    |0|         |0|*7*         |5|      |2|*m*
   He puts a song in my soul today—
      |0|        |9|*m*          |7|*-*|7|*7-*|0|
   A song of praise, hallelujah!

*2.* He placed me upon the
    strong Rock by His side;
   My steps were established,
    and here I’ll abide.
   No danger of falling
    while here I remain,
   But stand by His grace
    until the crown I gain.

*3.* He gave me a song;
    ‘twas a new song of praise.
   By day and by night
    its sweet notes I will raise.
   My heart’s overflowing;
    I’m happy and free.
   I’ll praise my Redeemer,
    Who has rescued me.

*4.* I’ll sing of His wonderful
    mercy to me;
   I’ll praise Him till all men
    His goodness shall see.
   I’ll sing of salvation
    at home and abroad,
   Till many shall hear the
    truth and trust in God.

*5.* I’ll tell of the pit,
    with its gloom and despair;
   I’ll praise the dear Father
    Who answered my prayer.
   I’ll sing my new song,
    the glad story of love,
   Then join in the chorus
   with the saints above.
