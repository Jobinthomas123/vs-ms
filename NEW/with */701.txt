1. The world may come against you;
                       |9|
    did you count the cost?
                   |9|7
   When family forsakes you,
     |7|         |9|   |9|7    |2|
    will you bear the cross?
            |9|7
   Though everyone may hate you,
     |7|       |9|-|9|7    |2|
    can you suffer loss?

Chorus:
   |2|                       |9|
   I died for you on Calvary.
                  |9|7
   What have you done
           |7|   |9|   |9|7   |2|
    with your life for Me?
   |2|                       |7|
   I died for you on Calvary.
                  |2|
   What have you done
           |9|  |9|7        |2|
    with your life for me?
     |9|            |9|7
   What have you done
          |7|   |9|7        |2|
    with your life for me?

2. The fame and wealth you’re seeking, are but vanity.
   All worldly joys are fleeting;
    can your heart now see?
   My child, to you I’m speaking,
    come and follow Me.

3. My sheep are without shepherds
    in the fields of sin.
   You who know the Savior,
    will you bring them in?
   Leave your own desires,
    precious souls to win.

4. You will be My treasure
    when you leave your all;
   My grace is without measure
    as you heed My call.
   Will you now surrender,
    love Me more than all?

5. My servants stand on Zion,
    for they followed Me.
   Their lives a song of heaven’s
    sacred mystery.
   They reign from holy Zion,
    through eternity.
