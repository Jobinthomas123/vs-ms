        |4|
I will praise Him
           |11|
  with my heart;
        |11|*7*
I will praise Him
           |4|
  with my voice. *x2*

                  |9|
And if I lose my voice,
         |11|                 |4|
I will praise Him with my hands.
                  |9|
And if I lose my hands,
         |11|                 |4|
I will praise Him with my feet.
                  |9|
And if I lose my feet,
         |11|                 |4|
I will praise Him with my soul.
                  |9|
And if I lose my soul
        |11|              |4|
I have gone to be with Him.
