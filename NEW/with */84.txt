       |4|                 |4|*7*
Reach out and touch the Lord
     |9|         |4|
 as He passes by;
                         |1|*m*
You’ll find He’s not too busy
     |6|*m*               |11|
 to hear your heart’s cry.
      |4|               |4|*7*
He’s passing by this moment--
       |9|            |4|
 your needs to supply.
      |4|                 |1|*m*
Reach out and touch the Lord
    |6|*m* |11|    |4|
 as He goes by.
