        |7|
Fill my cup, Lord;
               |2|
I lift it up, Lord.
         |9|*m*           |2|*7*
Come and quench this thirsting
        |7|
 of my soul;
          |7|        |7|*7*
Bread of heaven, feed me
         |0|       |9|*m*
 till I want no more.
        |2|            |2|*7*
Fill my cup; fill it up
               |7|
 and make me whole.
