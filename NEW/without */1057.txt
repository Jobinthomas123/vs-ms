   My liberty I give unto thee.

         |C|
    unto Me;

   In My name, demons flee.
                           |G|

2. I have seen your tears;
   Yes, My child,
    I’ve heard your prayers.
   I am come to deliver thee.
   Afflictions will now cease
   As My power I release.
   I’m moving in your midst,
    so be now free.

3. From captivity
   You will serve Me without fear.
   Prison doors, I have opened.
   No one can keep you bound,
   For My favor you have found.
   I’m moving in your midst,
    so be now free.
