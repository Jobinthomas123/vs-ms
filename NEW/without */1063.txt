       |C|                |E|m
1. My life is in God’s hand.
         |F|               |C|/|E|
   He’s working out His plan,
          |D|m
   And I know
        |G|
   I’m never going to
           |C| - |F|/|A| - |G|/|B|
   be the same.
      |C|             |E|m
   Directing from above
        |F|             |E|m
   His needlework of love,
              |D|m
   Oh what a mystery,
          |G|                 |C|
   His thoughts concerning me.
               |F|           |C|/|E|
   Though the battle rages on
            |D|m            |A|m
   And the path seems so long,
                     |D|m   -|G|
   It is only for a moment
                       |F|m/|C| - |C|
   Then I’ll be going home.

Chorus:
           |F|       |C|/|E|
   I will lift my eyes
           |F|       |C|/|E|
   To the King of love,
            |G|     |E|   |A|m
   To the heights of joy
          |D|        |G|
   New Jerusalem above.
            |F|      |C|/|E|
   Oh the crowning day
            |F|--|E|/|G#|-|A|m
   When we see His  face,
                          |D|m   -|G|
   Changed to glory in a moment
                       |F|m/|C| - |C|
   When finally we’re home.

2. Afflicted and in pain
   There’s glory to be gained
   As we wait
   For God to touch us once again.
   There is no need to fear;
   His promises are near.
   They’re bringing hope to us
   When we are in despair.
   As our Father sanctifies,
   There will be no surprise
   When we’re fashioned
    in a moment—
   Made ready for our home.

3. The signs around portray
   We’re nearing that great day
   When our Lord
   Will take His waiting bride away.
   And when the trumpet sounds
   The saints will gather round;
   Oh as we bow the knee
   To worship Christ the Lord.
   In the realm of glory bright—
   No more tears, no more night.
   All our trials will be over
   Forever in our home.
