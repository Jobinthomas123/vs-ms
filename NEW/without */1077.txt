Chorus:
     |C|            |C|/|E|
   Setting our affections
         |F|      |C|
    on things above—
             |A|m     |D|m7 – |G|7
   Jesus is coming soon.
    |C|            |C|/|E|
   Hoping and rejoicing
            |F|      |D|m
    in the One we love—
   |C|/|G|       |G|7     |C|
   Jesus is coming soon.

              |G|       |F|      |C|/|E|
1. From the dunghill He has raised us,
                |D|m        |G|       |C|
   Cleansed us from the stain of sin,
            |F|       |G|
   Made us His own sons
          |A|m
    and daughters—
                |D|7           |G|
   Through the veil to enter in.

2. Now we’re risen with Christ Jesus,
   Seeking only things above
   Where He’s seated with the Father
   Interceding in His love.

3. Though the devil tries to sway us
   From the path of truth and light,
   Jesus, our great Shepherd-leader
   Guides us in the way that’s right.

4. There in heaven saints are waiting
   Those in vict’ry gone before,
   So be strong, we too can conquer,
   Soon the battle will be o’er.

5. As we fix our gaze upon Him,
   Trusting in His help alone
   And we lift our voice rejoicing
   We will reach His glorious throne.

6. Shouts of joy
    when we shall see Him;
   Oh, the rapture of that day.
   Then forever we’ll adore Him
   Who redeemed us by His grace.
