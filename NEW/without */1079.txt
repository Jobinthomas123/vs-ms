Chorus:
      |D|  |E|m  |D|/|F#|
   Above all else, keep me
     |G|           |A|4– |A|
    faithful to You,
      |G|          |D|/|F#|
   Steadfast, immoveable,
        |B|m                  |A|
    in all You’ve called me to.
         |B|m              |A|/|C#|
   If I start to lose my way,
            |D|     |D|/|F#|     |E|m7
    if my heart begins to stray
            |G|2
   Draw me close,
      |F#|7                     |B|m
    until Your love breaks through.
             |E|sus4– |E|
   Above all else,
            |G|/|A|
    keep me faithful,
             |D|
   Lord, to You.

         |D|        |E|m     |D|/|F#|
1. Dear Jesus, I come to You with
           |G|             |A|sus4 – |A|
    some questions on my mind;
               |G|               |D|/|F#|
   There are problems I can’t solve,
             |B|m               |A|/|C#|
   There are answers I can’t find.
          |B|m               |D|/|A|
   Yet I know You’re the Solution
          |G|                  |D|/|F#|
   When things are still unclear,
           |E|m                |G|
   That is why I make this plea
                |A|4 – |A|
    for You to hear:

2. You told us that in these days
    many saints would fall away.
   We must take heed to ourselves;
    we must watch and always pray,
   Though I know these exhortations
   At times my love seems weak,
   So I cast myself on You
    and Your face seek.

3. “Against the evildoers,
    who for Me will take a stand?”
   I hear You cry:  “Mine eyes are on
    the faithful of the land.”
   “Who, me, Lord?
   I’m not worthy!”
   My feeble heart replies;
   Then I see Your smile,
    and grace is in Your eyes.

Bridge:
            |D|
   I will serve You
   |E|m–        |D|/|F#|    – |G|m6
    because I love You;
            |B|m   |A|–       |G|
   You have given life to me.
           |D|
   I will follow
   |E|m–      |D|/|F#|     |G|m6
    until I hear You say,
         |B|m               |A|
   “Well done, faithful servant,
             |G|
    come to Me.”
