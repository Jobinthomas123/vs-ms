1. Since I started for the Kingdom,
     |F|      |G|7           |C| â€“ |C|7
   Since my life He controls,
     |F|      |F|7      |Bb|       |D|m
   Since I gave my heart to Jesus,
        |F|/|C|
   The longer I serve Him
         |C|7         |F|
   The sweeter He grows.

Chorus:
        |C|        |C|7
   The longer I serve Him
          |F|
   The sweeter He grows;
        |C|           |C|7
   The more that I love Him
         |F|
   More love He bestows.
                      |F|7
   Each day is like heaven;
       |Bb|         |D|m
   My heart overflows,
        |F|/|C|
   The longer I serve Him
         |C|7         |F|
   The sweeter He grows.

2. Every need He is supplying;
   Plenteous grace He bestows.
   Every day my way gets brighter;
   The longer I serve Him
   The sweeter He grows.
