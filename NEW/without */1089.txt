Chorus:
 |D| -         |D|/|F#|
   My child, arise;
       |G|        |D|
   My Word is true.
         |G|            |D|
   You will break through
       |B|m        |A|
   And overcome evil.
 |D| -        |D|/|F#|
   And as I see
        |G|        |D|
   My promise through,
         |G|     |D|
   I'll carry you
       |B|m              |A| - |D|
   On wings like the eagle's.

      |B|m             |A|      |D|
1. In all of your trials I see you,
        |G|              |D|
   So just keep your eyes
            - |A|
    fixed on   Me.
    |G|           |D|       |F#|m   |G|
   My child, remember I love you;
    |E|m         |B|m
   What I’ve begun,
                    |A|
   Yes, I will complete.

2. The enemy is coming against you,
   For you are the one that I love.
   When all of hell’s fury is raging,
   Lift up your eyes,
   Help comes from above.

   Bridge:
     |G|                 |D|
   I am the King and Lord
          |A|   - |D|
    of creation,
      |G|
  I knew your name
       |D|          |A|  - |D|
    before your birth.
     |G|             |D|          |A|    - |D|
   I am the Author of your salvation,
         |G|
   None can compare
      |D|           |A|
   In all of the earth.
