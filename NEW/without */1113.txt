1. What love could remember
         |A|             |E|
    no wrongs we have done?
       |B|            |C#|m
   Omniscient, all-knowing,
         |A|              |B|sus
    He counts not their sum.
          |E|      |F#|m
   Thrown into a sea
            |E|/|G#|        |A|
    without bottom or shore,
   |E|/|G#|-|A|            |E|/|B|
   Our sins they are many;
         |B|-|B|6-|B|sus-|E|
    His mercy  is  more.

Chorus:
               |A| - |E| - |C#|m
   Praise the Lord;

2. What patience would wait
   as we constantly roam;
   What Father so tender
    is calling us home?
   He welcomes the weakest,
    the vilest, the poor.
   Our sins they are many;
    His mercy is more.

3. What riches of kindness
    He lavished on us.
   His blood was the payment;
    His life was the cost.
   We stood 'neath a debt
    we could never afford.
   Our sins they are many;
    His mercy is more
