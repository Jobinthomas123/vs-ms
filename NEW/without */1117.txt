(Key of |D|)
Chorus:
       |B|m
   The battles that we face

    are the Lord’s;
        |A|
   Our lives are hid
                   |E|m
    with Christ in God.
      |G|
   Jesus, the Lord of battles,
     |D|          |B|m
    our warfare handles—
      |A|
   Before His might
                   |D|
    no enemy can stand.

   |B|m
1. We do not wrestle
       |A|
    against flesh and blood
             |G|
   But with rulers of darkness
         |F#|
    and warriors thereof.
           |B|m
   They’re taller than cedars
           |A|
    and stronger than oaks;
      |G|
   Against us, they come
          |F#|
    to destroy us with their strokes.

Pre-chorus:
              |B|m
   But He Who slew great
                 |A|
    and famous kings
                 |E|m
   Protects His children
               |B|m
    under His wings.
             |B|m                 |A|
   He’s our Captain within the veil,
                    |E|m             |G|
   So the gates of hell cannot prevail.

2. We can’t be blind to
    the enemy’s schemes--
   Be aware that he works
    to entrap the redeemed.
   He roars like a lion, is sly as a fox,
   And seeks to devour our souls
    with all his plots.

Pre-chorus:
   But He Who slew
    great and famous kings
   Protects His children
    under His wings.
   At the cross where
    His blood was shed,
   He has crushed for us
    the serpent’s head.

Bridge:
               |B|m
   Behold, He comes and
                  |D|
    stands by my side,
                         |A|
   Military power to provide.
      |E|m
   I stand still in knowing through
           |D|
    the brightness of His coming
    |A|
   They’ll take flight,
                  |D|        |D|7
    for Him they dare not fight.
       |G|
   I claim the victory over
    |D|
    every enemy
          |A|
   And rejoice, for the battle
            |D|
    is the Lord’s.
