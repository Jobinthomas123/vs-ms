2. Jesus, You will be my strength,
    my guide and help;
   You promised to complete
    the work.
   A testimony of Your grace
   Will be the new song
    that I sing.

3. I have heard Your call,
    and so I come to You;
   I give my life to do Your will.
   The grace and power
    You’ll supply;
   Faithful You’ll keep me
    to Your call.
