Chorus:
    |A|
   Bigger than all my problems,
    |D|                   |A|
   Bigger than all my fears;
   |E|7      |A|               |F#|m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
           |A|             |E| – |E|7
   That I can or cannot see.
    |A|
   Bigger than all my questions,
    |D|               |A|
   Bigger than anything;
    |E|7     |A|              |F#|m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
          |E|7             |A|
   That I can or cannot see.

    |A|
1. Bigger than all the shadows
         |D|              |A|
   That fall across my path;
   |E|7      |A|               |F#|m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
           |A|             |E|–|E|7
   That I can or cannot see.
    |A|
   Bigger than all the confusion,
    |D|              |A|
   Bigger than anything;
   |E|7      |A|               |F#|m7
   God is bigger than any mountain
          |E|7             |A|
   That I can or cannot see.

2. Bigger than all the giants––
   Fear and unbelief;
   God is bigger than any mountain
   That I can or cannot see.
   Bigger than all my hang ups,
   Bigger than anything;
   God is bigger than any mountain
   That I can or cannot see.
