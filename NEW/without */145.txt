1. Seek ye first
         |7|          |2|
    the kingdom of God
   |7|        |2|        |9|
   And His righteousness.

    shall be added unto you.

   Hallelu, Hallelujah.

2. Ask, and it shall be given unto
    you.
   Seek, and ye shall find.
   Knock, and the door shall be
    opened unto you.
   Hallelu, Hallelujah.

3. Man shall not live by bread alone,
   But by every Word
   That proceeds from
    the mouth of God.
   Hallelu, Hallelujah.
