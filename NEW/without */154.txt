1. There is a fountain
     |2|            |9|
    filled with blood
                |6|m      |11|m—|4|
   Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;
        |9|         |9|7
   And sinners, plunged
       |2|           |9|
    beneath that flood,
                   |4|       |9|
   Lose all their guilty stains,
                   |4|       |2|-|11|m
   Lose all their guilty stains,
        |9|                  |4|
   Lose all their guilty stains.
        |9|         |9|7
   And sinners, plunged
       |2|           |9|
    beneath that flood
                   |4|       |9|
   Lose all their guilty stains.

2. The dying thief rejoiced to see
   That fountain in his day;
   And there may I,
    though vile as he,
   Wash all my sins away,
   Wash all my sins away,
   Wash all my sins away.
   And there may I,
    though vile as he,
   Wash all my sins away.

3. Thou dying Lamb,
    Thy precious blood
   Shall never lose its pow’r,
   Till all the ransomed church
    of God
   Are saved, to sin no more,
   Are saved, to sin no more,
   Are saved, to sin no more;
   Till all the ransomed church
    of God
   Are saved, to sin no more.

4. For since by faith I saw the stream
   Thy flowing wounds supply,
   Redeeming love has been
    my theme,
   And shall be till I die,
   And shall be till I die,
   And shall be till I die;
   Redeeming love has been
    my theme,
   And shall be till I die.

5. Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
   I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save,
   When this poor lisping,
    stamm’ring tongue
   Lies silent in the grave,
   Lies silent in the grave,
   Lies silent in the grave;
   When this poor lisping,
    stamm’ring tongue
   Lies silent in the grave.
