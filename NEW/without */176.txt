1. Beneath the cross of Jesus
      |2|m         |7|         |0|
    I fain would take my stand,
        |9|m         |5|      |2|m
   The shadow of a mighty Rock
     |7|m       |11|    |4|7
    within a weary land;
      |0|      |9|m       |0|     |0|7
   A home within the wilderness,
       |5|     |2|m      |7|
    a rest upon the way,
             |7|7
   From the burning
            |0|        |9|m
    of the noontide heat
            |0|     |7|        |0|
   And the burden of the day.

2. Upon that cross of Jesus
    mine eye at times can see
   The very dying form of One
    Who suffered there for me;
   And from my smitten heart
    with tears two wonders I confess,
   The wonders of redeeming love
    and my unworthiness.

3. I take, O cross, thy shadow
    for my abiding place;
   I ask no other sunshine
    than the sunshine of His face.
   Content to let the world go by,
    to know no gain nor loss,
   My sinful self my only shame,
    my glory all the cross.
