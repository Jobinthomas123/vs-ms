         |2|            |9|
1. The shadow of Thy wings is nigh;
        |9|7
   Thou art my Shepherd,
     |2|
    rod and staff.
         |2|7
   Thou leadest me
         |7|
    with watchful eye;
         |2|            |9|7 |2|
   Thou diedst on my behalf.

Chorus:
        |2|               |9|7
   Thy love enchanteth me.
                        |2|
   Thy love enchanteth me.
      |2|7                |7|
   I rest content for Thee I know;
        |2|          |9|7   |2|
   Thy love enchanteth me.

2. The comfort of Thy dying love
   Surpasseth that of mortal man.
   Its length, the breadth,
    and depth, and height,
   Thy saints alone can span.

3. When bitter conflicts
    cross my path,
   Misunderstood by friends
    held dear,
   Thy Word will guide and
    bear me through,
   Love casteth out all fear.

4. O Love, that bindeth strong
    as death,
   And keepeth sealed upon
    Thy heart,
   I’m not ashamed to bear
    Thy cross,
   E’en though my life depart.
