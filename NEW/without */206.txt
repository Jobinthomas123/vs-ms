1. There’s within my heart
      |6|7
    a melody.
    |11|7                       |4|–|11|7
   Jesus whispers sweet and low,
     |4|
   “Fear not, I am with thee,
     |6|7
    peace, be still,”
   |11|7                         |4|
   In all of life’s ebb and flow.

Chorus:
    |4|             |6|m7   |11|
   Jesus, Jesus, Jes  —  us,
                     |4|
   Sweetest name I know,
                   |6|m7
   Fills my ev’ry longing,
    |11|7                    |4|
   Keeps me singing as I go.

2. All my life was wrecked by
    sin and strife;
   Discord filled my heart with pain.
   Jesus swept across the
    broken strings,
   Stirred the slumb’ring chords
    again.

3. Feasting on the riches
    of His grace,
   Resting ‘neath His shelt’ring wing,
   Always looking on His
    smiling face,
   This is why I shout and sing!

4. Tho’ sometimes He leads
    thro’ waters deep,
   Trials fall across the way,
   Tho’ sometimes the path seems
    rough and steep,
   See His footprints all the way.

5. Soon He’s coming back
    to welcome me,
   Far beyond the starry sky.
   I shall wing my flight to
    worlds unknown;
   I shall reign with Him on high.
