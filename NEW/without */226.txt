1. I love to tell the story
       |0|             |7|
   Of unseen things above,
       |2|              |7|
   Of Jesus and His glory,
            |9|7       |2|
   Of Jesus and His love.
     |2|7                |0| |7|
   I love to tell the story,
     |4|m                |11|7
   Because I know ‘tis true.
       |0|            |7|
   It satisfies my longings,
       |2|               |7|
   As nothing else can do.

Chorus:
      |2|                 |7|
   I love to tell the story!
           |0|                |7|
   ‘Twill be my theme in glory
                          |0|
   To tell the old, old story
        |7|   |2|        |7|
   Of Jesus and His love.

2. I love to tell the story;
   More wonderful it seems
   Than all the golden fancies
   Of all our golden dreams.
   I love to tell the story;
   It did so much for me,
   And that is just the reason
   I tell it now to thee.

3. I love to tell the story;
   ‘Tis pleasant to repeat
   What seems each time I tell it,
   More wonderfully sweet.
   I love to tell the story,
   For some have never heard
   The message of salvation
   From God’s own holy Word.

4. I love to tell the story,
   For those who know it best
   Seem hungering and thirsting
   To hear it like the rest.
   And when, in scenes of glory,
   I sing the new, new song,
   ‘Twill be the old, old story,
   That I have loved so long.
