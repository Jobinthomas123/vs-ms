Chorus:
  |7|
   I am saved, yes, I am saved,
                   |4|m     |9|m |2|7
   Hallelujah! Oh, I am saved.
       |9|m                |2|7
   He took my sins that day
        |9|m              |2|7
   And washed them all away.
        |9|m         |2|7    |7|
   Hallelujah! Oh, I am saved.

               |7|
1. I once was lost in the valley

    of sin’s domain;
                    |4|m       |9|m  |2|7
   I had no joy or peace within.
        |9|m            |2|7
   Then I heard Jesus call me,
         |9|m              |2|7
   With arms held out before me;
                           |7|
   I fell repenting of my sins.

2. It was so dark in the valley;
    I could not see.
   My feet would stumble all the day,
   But Christ the Sun has risen,
   New life to me has given;
   Now happily I’m on my way.

3. Now I’m a child of my Father
    in heav’n above
   Through faith in Jesus Christ
    the Son.
   I’ve gone into the water;
   My faith is so much broader.
   Through Calvary it’s all been
    done.

4. And, I’ve gone up to the
    mountain;
    the fire came down,
   The Holy Spirit dwells within.
   His fire burns within me;
   With new tongues I am singing
   Of how He set me free from sin.

5. I’m pressing on through to vict’ry
    in Jesus’ name.
   I’m leaving all this world behind.
   I want to see the fountain
   That flows from Zion’s mountain;
   With Jesus we will rule and shine.
