1. Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
                 |2|7        |7|
   Let me hide myself in Thee.
            |2|7             |7|
   Let the water and the blood,
             |2|
   From Thy wounded side
            |7|
    which flowed,
                   |0|     |7|
   Be of sin the double cureâ€”

   Save from wrath
         |2|7      |7|
    and make me pure.

2. Could my tears forever flow,
   Could my zeal no languor know,
   These for sin could not atone.
   Thou must save, and Thou alone.
   In my hand no price I bring;
   Simply to Thy cross I cling.

3. While I draw this fleeting breath,
   When my eyes shall close in
    death,
   When I rise to worlds unknown,
   And behold Thee on Thy throne,
   Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
   Let me hide myself in Thee.
