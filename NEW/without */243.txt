2. Silent night! Holy night!
   Shepherds quake at the sight!
   Glories stream from heaven afar;
   Heavenly hosts sing, “Alleluia!”
   Christ, the Savior, is born!
   Christ, the Savior, is born!

3. Silent night! Holy night!
   Son of God love’s pure light!
   Radiant beams from Thy holy face
   With the dawn of
    redeeming grace,
   Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
   Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.
