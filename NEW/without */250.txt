1. Through mountains and valleys

    it led them each night,
                           |11|7
   A star of most radiant light.
        |4|m
   The wise men rejoiced,
              |9|m
    as they travelled afar,
         |4|m           |11|7        |4|m
   To behold such a beautiful star.

     |4|m
   When they saw the star,

   They rejoiced with great joy.
     |9|m
   When they saw the star,
                            |4|m
   They rejoiced with great joy.
     |4|m
   When they saw the star,

   They rejoiced with great joy;
                         |2|
   They rejoiced with exceeding
           |4|m
    great joy.

2. The star others saw,
    but they followed it not;
   To them it would come
    and would pass.
   But, th’ wise men kept trusting
    with all of their heart
   That the star’d find
    the Baby at last.

   And when they saw the star
   They rejoiced with great joy.
   And when they saw the star
   They rejoiced with great joy.
   And when they saw the star
   They rejoiced with great joy.
   They rejoiced with exceeding
    great joy.

3. So often I travelled
    in darkness of night
   With no one to show me the way,
   But one day the Lord
    let His light shine on me
   Now I’m walking
    in His love every day.

   And when I saw the light,
   I rejoiced with great joy.
   And when I saw the light,
   I rejoiced with great joy.
   And when I saw the light,
   I rejoiced with great joy.
   I rejoiced with exceeding
    great joy.
