1. O little town of Bethlehem,
         |4|       |11|7       |4|
   How still we see thee lie.
     |4|        |1|
   Above thy deep and
      |6|m
    dreamless sleep
        |4|       |11|7      |4|
   The silent stars go by.
                             |8|
   Yet in thy dark streets shineth
        |1|m         |8|
   The everlasting Light.
        |4|
   The hopes and fears
       |9|
    of all the years
        |4|       |11|7    |4|
   Are met in thee tonight.

2. For Christ is born of Mary
   And gathered all above,
   While mortals sleep,
    the angels keep
   Their watch of wond’ring love.
   O morning stars, together
   Proclaim the holy birth;
   And praises sing to God, the King,
   And peace to men on earth.

3. How silently, how silently,
   The wondrous gift is giv’n!
   So God imparts to human hearts
   The blessings of His heav’n.
   No ear may hear His coming,
   But in this world of sin,
   Where meek souls will
    receive Him still,
   The dear Christ enters in.

4. O holy Child of Bethlehem,
   Descend on us, we pray.
   Cast out our sin and enter in;
   Be born in us today.
   We hear the Christmas angels
   The great glad tidings tell;
   O come to us, abide with us,
   Our Lord Emmanuel!
