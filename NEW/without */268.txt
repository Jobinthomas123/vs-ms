Come bless the Lord,
                        |9|7
All ye servants of the Lord,

Which stand by night
                     |2|
In the house of the Lord.
                  —|2|7
Lift up your hands
              |7| –|4|m7
In the Holy Place.
               |2|—|9|
And bless the Lord,
               |2|
And bless the Lord.
