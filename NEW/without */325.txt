          |7|           |7|7
Put your hand to the plow;
 |0|                  |9|m7
Don’t you look back now.

Remember Lot’s wife,
                        |7|
And take heed for your life.
                        |7|7
You’re the salt of the earth,
       |0|            |9|m7
Not a pillar of no worth;
    |2|                    |7|
So put your hand to the plow.

          |7|          |7|7
See that field over there—
      |0|               |9|m7
Just waiting for the plow.
     |2|
The laborers are few,
            |0|              |7|
That’s why God has chosen you.
                              |7|7
Let’s work quick before it’s night;
     |0|                  |9|m7
The harvest fields are white,
    |2|                    |7|
So put your hand to the plow.
