1. Loved with everlasting love,
    |11|m                |4|7       |9|
   Led by grace that love to know,
     |2|       |11|m        |7|    |2|
   Spirit, breathing from above,
     |4|7                      |9|
   Thou hast taught me it is so!
   |7|        |6|m       |4|m |9|     |2|
   Oh, this full and perfect peace!
    |7|         |6|m     |4|m    |9|
   Oh, this transport all divine!


   x2
   |7|    |6|m        |4|m |9|     |2|
   In a love which cannot cease
        |11|m      |4|m  |9|   |2|
   I am His and He is mine.


2. Things that once were wild alarms,
   Cannot now disturb my rest—
   Closed in everlasting arms,
   Pillowed on the loving breast.
   Oh, to lie forever here,
   Doubt and care and self resign


   x2
   While He whispers in my ear.
   I am His, and He is mine.


3. His forever, only His—
   Who the Lord and me shall part?
   Ah, with what a rest of bliss
   Christ can fill the loving heart!
   Heaven and earth may fade
    and flee,
   Firstborn light in gloom decline,


   x2
   But while God and I shall be
   I am His and He is mine.
