1. He humbled Himself
              |2|
    and came down to earth;
                         |7|m
   He left His majesty above.

   He took on the form
            |2|
    of the Son of Man;
                                 |7|m
   The Word of God in flesh was He.

Chorus:
    |3|  |2|m           |0|m
   How great is His love!
       |3|             |2|m
   To Him praise and honor
          |7|m
    now bring.
   |3|     |2|m         |0|m
   Every knee shall bow
      |3|         |2|m          |7|
   Before Christ Jesus, the King!

2. He could have proclaimed Himself
    King of kings,
   But chose to be the least of all;
   No glory, no honor
    He sought from men,
   But sought His Father’s
    praise instead.

3. He prayed to the Father
    to do His will—
   The hearts of fallen men to win;
   He healed all the sick
    and forgave their sin
   To show the love of God for man.

4. He came as a lamb
    for the sacrifice;
   So holy, without spot was He.
   He poured out His soul,
    and His blood was shed
   To pay the penalty of sin.

5. God raised Jesus up
    from the cruel grave
   To break the chains
    of sin and death!
   He sits on the right hand
    of God above;
   He’s King of kings
    and Lord of lords.
