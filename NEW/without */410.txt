Chorus:
      |E|          |B|
   My God and my King,
       |A|            |B|
   My joy in everything;
       |E|          |B|
   My God and my King,
            |A|                  |B|
   Oh, the love that You will bring.

           |E|            |G#|m
1. When I look to You above,
        |A|                 |B|
   You rest Your love in me.
              |E|
   On the throne, You’re King
        |G#|m
    of kings;
            |A|            |B|
   You’re rejoicing over me.

2. In the days I feel so down,
   You shed Your love abroad;
   In my sad and lonely times,
   You’re still King inside my heart.

3. When in days I seem so bad,
   You rain Your love on me.
   You’re the King from Zion above;
   You came to set me free.

Ending:
       |E|          |B|
   My God and my King,
      |A|             |B|
   Forever King of kings;
       |E|          |B|
   My God and my King,
          |E|            |B|
   Oh, forever I will sing,
            |E|
    I will sing.
