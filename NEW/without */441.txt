1. There is a place in the heavens
            |F|
   That my heart is longing for;
         |G|
   I’d gladly give my whole life
           |F|        |C|
   To be there evermore.
       |C|
   I hear the sound of harpers

    playing—
    |F|
   Singing their new song
          |D|7
   Their praise breaks forth

    like thunder—
            |G|4
   Such a great and mighty
        |G|  —|D|m7 - |G|
    throng.

Chorus:
   |C|
   Oh, I want to praise You
            |G|4-|G|
   In Your Holy Mountain, Lord;
|D|m7                    |G|7
   I want to be right with You
             |C|   |F|    |C|
   In Mount Zion evermore.
|F|                       |G|/|F|
   I pray You’ll take me to perfection
   |E|m7            |A|m
   Each and ev’ry day;
       |D|m
   Oh, I want to reach
          |G|              |C|
    Your Holy Mountain, Lord.

|C|7-|F|                         |G|
2.  They’re servants of the Lord;
                      |C|
   There they shall serve Him
          |A|m
    evermore.
|D|m                       |G|7
   They followed Jesus wholly—
               |C|         |C|7
   Firstfruits unto the Lord;
  |F|                         |G|/|F|
   They’ll see Him face to face,
                     |E|m7
   They’ll rule and reign
               |A|m
    on His throne.
  |F|
   The heights of Zion —
      |G|           |C|
   Their eternal home.
