1. Jerusalem,
     |B|m/|A|         |G|ma7     -|A| - |B|m
    city of the great King,
                           |B|m/|A|
   Saints of God, of her glory
          |G|ma7      - |A| - |B|m
    ever shall sing;

   Gates of pearl,
       |G|               |D|
    street of shining gold,
  |B|m            |G|ma7
   Always new, nothing there
          |D|
    grows old.

Chorus:
         |D|              |C|/|D|
   It’s miles high and miles wide,
    |G|/|D|                 |D|
   Love that cannot be measured.
           |D|
   There’s endless joy
               |C|/|D|
   ‘Cause the Lord is there—
        |G|/|D|                |D|
   His presence our only pleasure.
                         |C|/|D|
   That’s why we love Jerusalem.
  |D|                      |C|/|D|   - |D|
   That’s why we love Jerusalem.

           |G|     |A|    |D|
   Let us go up to Jerusalem,
    |G|           |A|      |D|
   City of the living God;
  |G|          |E|m        |B|m
   God will dwell with men,
  |E|7                      |A|
   All their tears wipe away;
            |G|   |A|        |D|
   Mighty city with foundations,
    |G|           |A|        |D|
   Builder and Maker is God;
  |G|         |E|m        |B|m
   Healing for ev’ry nation,
  |E|7                  |A|
   Joy in all of the earth.

   (Ending:
  |G|       |A|          |D|
   Joy in all of the earth.)

2. There’s no more pain,
   No more fear to die.
   Crystal clear flowing river
    of pure life;
   No more curse,
   No more darkness there.
   Throne of God
   And the Lamb we’ll share.

3. Oh, see the bride’s glory,
   She’s the Lamb’s wife.
   Loved Him so,
   Even more than her own life;
   Has no spot, she is oh so fair!
   Robes of white,
   Crown of joy she’ll wear.
