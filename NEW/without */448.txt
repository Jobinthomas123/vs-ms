Chorus:
   |D|         |A|/|D|  |G|/|D|
   How lovely is Your
         |D|
    dwelling place,
|E|m7   |A|      |D|
   Almighty Lord.
     |B|m
   There’s a hunger
     |E|7             |A|
    deep inside my soul.
    |D|  |A|/|D|  |G|/|D|     |D|
   Only in Your presence
           |F#|
   Are my heart and mind
        |B|m — |B|m/|A|
    restored;
        |G|
   How lovely is Your
      |A|        |D|
    dwelling place.

       |G|/|D|
1. Oh, in Your courts
      |A|/|D|     |D|
    there’s shelter
            |G|/|D|         |A|/|D|   |D|
   For the greatest and the small.
          |E|m      |D|/|F#|    |G|
   Even sparrows have a place
        |G|/|A|    |A|    |D|
    to build their nest.
        |F|                |E|m
   The pilgrim finds refreshment
       |D|m                  |B|/|D#|
    in all the rains that fall,
        |E|m7                  |E|7
   And each one finds the strength
                 |A|4 – |A|
    to meet the test.

2. A single day is better
   Which is spent in humble praise,
   Than a thousand days of living
    without You!
   The Lord bestows His favor
    on each one who obeys,
   And blessings on the man
    whose heart is true.
