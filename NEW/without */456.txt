         |E|              |F#|m
1. If I had to do it all over again,
              |A|
   I’d serve Jesus ev’ry
     |B|         |E|
    day of my life;

   For I’ve found He alone
         |F#|m
    can really satisfy
          |A|            |B|
   And deliver me from all
                |E|
    sin and  strife.

Chorus:
              |A|                |E|
   Yes, it’s Jesus — the only One,
|F#|m - |B|     |A|/|E|       |E|
   Jesus — God’s only Son.
              |A|
   Yes, it’s Jesus
                     |E|
    Who set my soul free,
             |F#|m
   And it’s Jesus Christ
            |B|              |E|
    that’s coming back for me!

2. If you’re looking for life,
    stop looking right now,
   For it’s Jesus Who can
    give life to you;
   So just open your heart
    and unlock now its door,
   And let Jesus cleanse your life
    through and through.
