Chorus
  |G|
   The Lord’s my Shepherd;
 |E|m7                 —|D|—
    I lack in nothing.
  |C|
   He makes me lie down
        |G|/|D|-|D|        |C|   —|D|—
    in pastures of green;
  |G|
   He leads me onward
 |E|m7
    by whispering waters,
          |C|
   He restores my soul
         |G|/|B|
   And guides me
            |A|m7  |C|/|D|     |G|
    for the sake of His name.

|D|/|F#|-|E|m                |B|m7
1.     If I should journey through
     |C|           |D|      |G|
    death’s dark valley land,
    |E|m          |G|7
   I know there is no need
       |C|—|D|
    to fear;
 |E|m        |G|7             |C|ma7
   I am protected by the staff
             |B|7
    in Your hand,
            |E|m             |G|/|A|
   And I’m comforted just knowing
      |A|         |D|
    that You’re near.

2. You’ve spread a table in the
    midst of evry foe;
   You fill my cup now
    with Your love.
   Your tender mercies are
    with me as I go,
   And I’ll dwell forever
    in Your house above.
