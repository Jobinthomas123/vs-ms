1. What a fellowship,
     |C|     |A|m

2. Oh, how sweet to walk
    in this pilgrim way,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms;
   Oh, how bright the path grows
    from day to day,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.

3. What have I to dread?
   What have I to fear—
   Leaning on the everlasting arms?
   I have blessed peace
    with my Lord so near,
   Leaning on the everlasting arms.
