1. Down at the cross
              |C|      |G|
    where my Savior died,
                   |E|m
   Down where for cleansing
          |A|7     |D|
    from sin I cried—
     |G|          |G|7
   There to my heart
              |C|       |G|
    was the blood applied;
          |D|      |G|
   Glory to His name!

Chorus:
     |C|           |G|
   Glory to His name!
         |E|m     |A|7-|D|
   Glory to His name!
     |G|          |G|7
   There to my heart
              |C|       |G|
    was the blood applied;
          |D|      |G|
   Glory to His name!

2. I am so wondrously
    saved from sin;
   Jesus so sweetly abides within.
   There at the cross
    where He took me in—
   Glory to His name!

3. Oh, precious fountain
    that saves from sin—
   I am so glad I have entered in.
   There Jesus saves me
    and keeps me clean;
   Glory to His name!

4. Come to the fountain
    so rich and sweet;
   Cast thy poor soul
    at the Savior’s feet.
   Plunge in today
    and be made complete;
   Glory to His name!
