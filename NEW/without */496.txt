|C|             |G|
 Sing to the Lord,
         |A|m
  O ye saints of His;
|F|               |G|
 Give thanks unto
            |C|
  His holy name.
|A|m            |E|m
 For when I cried for help,
    |F|                |C|
 He rescued me from hell;
|F|m
 He healed me from grief
       |G|—|F|/|G|—|G|
  and pain.

  |C|           |G|
 Weeping may last
          |A|m
  for a nighttime,
|F|               |G|
 But joy comes early
          |C|
  in the morn;
|A|m               |E|m
 He’s turned my mourning
        |F|               |C|
  into dancing now for me,
|F|
 Put off my sackcloth
       |G|  |F|  |C|/|E|      |D|m7  |G|
  and girded me with gladness.

Ending:
  |G|  |F|  |C|/|E|     |D|m7  |G|-|C|
 Girded me with gladness.
