I will sing, I will dance,
          |C|7
I will rejoice in the Lord
     |G|
 my God.
                     |E|m
I will sing, I will dance,

Singing is a pleasure to the Lord,
         |G|            |E|m
For He inhabits the praises
         |D|-|D|7
 of His people;
 |G|                 |C|/|G|    |G|-|E|m
Dancing is a joy unto His heart,
           |G|            |D|7
So I will sing, I will dance
           |G|
 unto the Lord.
