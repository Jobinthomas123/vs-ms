1. Jesus is my Savior;
   |B|7
   I shall not be moved.

   In His love and favor,
   |E|
   I shall not be moved;
               |A|            |F#|m
   Just like a tree that’s planted
            |E|-|C#|m
    by the waters, Lord,
   |E|       |B|7      |E|
   I shall not be moved.

Chorus:
   |E|
   I shall not be,
   |B|7
   I shall not be moved.

   I shall not be,
   |E|
   I shall not be moved;
               |A|             |F#|m
   Just like a tree that’s planted
            |E|-|C#|m
    by the waters, Lord,
   |E|        |B|7     |E|
   I shall not be moved.

2. In my Christ abiding,
   I shall not be moved.
   In His love I’m hiding;
   I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that’s planted
    by the waters, Lord,
   I shall not be moved.

3. If I trust Him ever,
   I shall not be moved;
   He will fail me never,
   I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that’s planted
    by the waters, Lord,
   I shall not be moved.

4. On His Word I’m feeding;
   I shall not be moved.
   He’s the One that’s leading;
   I shall not be moved.
   Just like a tree that’s planted
    by the waters, Lord,
   I shall not be moved.
