1. Now with My stripes
             |B|7
    you’re healed,
        |E|                   |A|
   And by My blood you’re free;
       |E|                 |B|7
   And with the grace I give,
            |A|               |E|
   You can reign victoriously.

2. Now you can do all things,
   If you will just believe;
   The devil, he must flee,
   When you put your trust in Me.

3. My power I now give
   To make you witnesses;
   Preach My Word and see
   All the souls I will set free!

4. The weak can say, “I’m strong!”
   When to Me they belong;
   Sufficient is My grace,
   So be faithful, run the race.
