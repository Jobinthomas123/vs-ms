 |G|                          |E|m
Jesus Christ is coming back soon

 to call His saints home,
    |C|               |G|
To gather all His chosen,
          |D|4—|D|
 all the faithful.
 |G|                   |E|m
He cannot delay any longer,
                      |C|
 for us now, He’ll return;
                |G|    |D|    |G|
His face we’ll see forevermore.

              |E|m
And we’ll be singing and shouting,
        |G|
 “Hallelujah!”
             |E|m
The King of love, we’ll praise
              |D|
 and lift up high!
               |E|m
All tears and sadness

 He’ll remove
                |C|            |G|
 and make the shadows flee away
      |C|           |G|
When we meet our Jesus
 |D|        |G|
 in the sky.
