          |D|m
   I will sing to the Lord

   His right hand is mighty
        |D|m

1. He has thrown in the sea,
                        |D|m
    all those who did chase us;
                      |C|/|D|
   The horse and his rider,
                       |D|m
    He’s thrown in the sea.

         |G|m              |A|
    and chariots in the sea.

2. My Father is God,
    and I will exalt Him;
   My Strength and my Song,
    in Him I’ll rejoice.


   He cast Pharoah’s host
    and chariots in the sea.
