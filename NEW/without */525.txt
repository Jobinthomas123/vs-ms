1. Our Jesus died, shed His blood

    on the cross;
  |E|
   He came to seek and to save
                —|D|/|F#|
    all the lost
  |G|                       |D|
   And paid the price to make
                |A|—|C|—|G|
    salvation free.
  |D|
   He broke the chains, rising up

    from the dead;
  |E|
   He conquered hell, bruised
                       —|D|/|F#|
    the serpent’s head.
  |G|                          |C|
   He cried, “O grave, now where’s
               |A|
    your victory?”

Chorus:
          |D|                   |G|
   Oh, Christ burst open the tomb,
         |E|
   The prince of darkness
        |A|
    He doomed
         |F#|
   And death is swallowed
        |B|m — |A| —— |G|
    in vic — to — ry;
   |D|/|F#| |E|            |A|7
   He  lives forevermore!
      |D|                   |G|
   Beyond the heavens He soared—
         |E|                 |A|
   Now King and Sovereign Lord;
       |F#|              |B|m
   For all authority, pow’r,
     |A|-|B|m-|A|
    dominion
    |G|            |A|
   Christ has secured.

(Ending:
    |G|            |A|         |D|
   Christ has secured evermore.)

2. The Son of God He was
    proven to be,
   Alive again for the
    whole world to see;
   The Savior came,
    from sin to set men free.
   With mighty power our Jesus
    arose,
   His body raised
    by the Holy Ghost;
   Because He lives,
    we’ll live eternally!

3. Now Jesus sits at
    the Father’s right hand,
   His ev’ry foe bowing at His
    command;
   The keys of hell and death are
    in His hand.
   Just as He went,
    He will one day return,
   Oh, how that hope makes
    our hearts now to burn—
   That when He comes,
    before Him we shall stand!
