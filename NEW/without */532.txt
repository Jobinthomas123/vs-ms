   Holy Spirit, move in me;
                    |A|m
   Take my whole life and
            |D|m7-|G|
    let me be
           |C|              |F|-|D|m7
   Just a vessel all for Thee.
          |C|   |G|          |C|
   Holy Spirit, move in me.

           |D|m7      |G|
1. Take my life, O Lord,
               |C|ma7
    and please use me;
         |D|m7    |G|7           |C|
   Empty me of self and vanity.
                |F|    |F|m
   Cleanse and sanctify
             |C|
    by Thy Spirit;
           |D|
   Let the life of Christ
                |G|
    be seen in me.

2. Here am I, O Lord,
    so now send me
   To tell others
    of Thy wondrous love;
   In the harvest fields, I will labor.
   Grant me strength and wisdom
    from above.

3. As I journey, Lord,
    toward that city,
   I’ll employ my service
    all for Thee;
   By Your grace and love
    I’ll be faithful
   Till Thy face in glory I shall see.
