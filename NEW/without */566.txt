       |A|m            |E|m
1. As David did in Jehovah’s sight,
   |A|m                |E|m
   I will dance with all my might
     |G|                |A|m
   Before the King of kings!
       |A|m
   As Miriam did with the
      |E|m
    tambourine,
   |A|m             |E|m
   I will clap my hands and sing
     |G|                 |A|m
   Before the King of kings!

Chorus:
    |F|            |G|
   We can come before Him
         |F|             |A|m
    and worship Him today;
    |F|           |G|
   We can now adore Him—
    |F|              |A|m
    Jesus made the way!

2. As Judah did on the battle ground,
   We will make a joyful sound
   Before the King of kings!
   As Joshua did at Jericho,
   We will shout to defeat the foe
   Before the King of kings!
