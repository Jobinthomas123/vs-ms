    |C|          |D|        |E|m
    all throughout the land.
           |C|     |D|        |E|m
   Follow My decrees you must;
      |C|         |B|7

Chorus:
             |E|m           |G|
   It is the Year of Jubilee,
            |A|m
   When the lame shall walk,
           |B|7
    and the blind shall see,
             |E|m
   When the Lord sets
         |A|m        |B|7
    the captives free.
             |E|m       |B|7 |E|m
   It is the Year of Jubilee.

2. Sound the trumpet, Israel;
    let the people hear.
   It is I the Lord your God
    Who now draws you near;
   I have not forsaken you,
    so thereâ€™s no need to fear.
   It is the Year of Jubilee.

3. Sound the trumpet everywhere;
    let His praises ring.
   Yeshua has redeemed mankind;
    salvation He brings.
   By His precious sacrifice,
    we now are standing free.
   It is the Year of Jubilee.
