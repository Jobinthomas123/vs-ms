1. At all times I will bless Him;
          |C|                  |G|
   His praise will be in my mouth.
       |A|m             |E|m
   My soul makes its boast
            |B|
    in the Lord.

Chorus:
            |G|        |D|/|F#|   |E|m
   Let us exalt His name together,
       |B|m
    forever;
      |A|m                  |B|m
   I sought the Lord, He heard me,
         |C|          |A|/|C#|     |D|4 - |D|
   And delivered me from my fears.
           |G|        |D|/|F#|   |E|m
   Let us exalt His name together,
       |B|m
    forever;
        |A|m
   Oh, sing His praises,
     |B|m          |E|m
    magnify the Lord.

2. The angel of the Lord encamps
   ‘Round those who fear His name,
   To save them and deliver them
    from harm.
   Though lions roar with hunger,
   We lack for no good thing;
   No wonder then we praise Him
    with our song.

3. Come children, now,
    and hear me,
   If you would see the light,
   Just keep your lips from
    wickedness and lies.
   Do good and turn from evil;
   Seek peace instead of strife.
   Love righteousness and God
    will hear your cry.
