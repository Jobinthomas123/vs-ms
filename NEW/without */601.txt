        |D|m              |C|
1.This race is hard to run,
               |A|m
  But God has given grace
     |D|m
  to overcome.
                            |C|
  You may stumble and fall down,
            |A|m
  And your feet may want
      |D|m
  to turn around;
                     |C|
  But remember the cross,
               |A|m
  the One Who died
              |A|#
  For you and all that
             |D|m
  He went through.

Chorus:
     |D|m             |C|
  Christ is coming soon;
       |A|#                 |D|m
  He’s coming for me and you,
      |F|                |C|
  So run the race with all you have.
        |A|m7
  You’re almost there,
       |C|     |A|m   |A|#
  now don’t look back.
            |D|m   |A|m        |A|#
  Keep your eyes on that crown
                   |D|m/|A|
  And soon you’ll hear the words,
    |C|    |D|m
  “Well done.”

2.During this race you may feel
  That you are all alone
   and God’s not there.
  You may feel depressed and say,
  “Why Lord? Why me? Why 
   today?”
  But, remember the blood
   that was shed
  For you on the cross of Calvary.

3.The race is drawing to a close,
  And there are many
   who have fallen away.
  But, there are still that remain
  That have their eyes
   on the day He comes.
  So, remember you’re the bride
  That the Lord wants to receive
   to His side.
