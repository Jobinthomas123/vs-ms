  |D|                  |A|/|E|
1. If I rise on the wings of the
     |B|m-|B|m/|A|
    morning
        |G|           |D|
   And dwell in the uttermost
     |E|m           |A|
    parts of the sea,
  |D|                 |A|/|E|
   Even there Your hand
     |B|m      |B|m/|A|
    leads me onward,
        |G|
   And Your right hand’s
     |D|         |E|m       |A|
    holding me unto the end.

Chorus:
  |G|            |D|
   I shall not faint
         |F#|   |B|m
    nor be dismayed,
        |G|          |D|
   For You help me mount up
          |E|m         |A|4-|A|
    with wings as an eagle.
  |G|            |D|
   I shall not faint
         |F#|    |B|m
    nor be dismayed,
       |G|         |D|
   For until the end,  Lord,
    |A|             |D|
    I’ll be with You.

2. Precious are Your thoughts
    unto me, O God!
   How great is the sum of them.
   Were I to count them,
   How they would outnumber
    the grains of sand;
   When I shall awake, Lord,
    I’m still with You.
