      |E|             |B|     |E|
1. I came to Him in dire need;
       |A|      |B|          |E| – |E|7
   My life I could not change.
          |A|     |B|       |E|
   And, when I saw His mercy so
      |C#|m
    great,
      |F#|              |B|
   In love to Him I clave.

   Sufficient was His grace to me;
   He never let me down.
   I was so happy in His work—
   His strength for labor found.

Chorus:
      |A|         |B|    |E|        |C#|m
   Oh, I could never live without
        |A|     |B|       |E| – |E|7
    my Savior and my King,
       |A|       |B|         |E|       |C#|m
   And I will serve Him till the end
          |F#|m7     |B|       |E|
    for what He’s done for me.

2. After some time of serving Him,
   My heart began to doubt;
   I did not know which road to take,
   And to Him I cried out.

   Oh, once again,
    please save me, Lord!
   Deliver me from sin!
   And once again, His loving hand,
   In mercy took me in.

3. A God of restoration, He
   Restored that which was lost;
   And brought me back into
    first love,
   But bid me count the cost.

   I said, dear Lord,
    please pierce my ear;
   I’ve seen Your faithfulness.
   I never want to leave your side;
   I’ll serve You till the end.

4. My life’s now bound
    by love’s strong cords;
   I never can go free.
   To Him forever I belong,
   And He belongs to me.

   Oh, soon I know I’ll see His face;
   My fiery trials will pass,
   And so till then I’ll seek His grace,
   Till with Him safe at last.

(Spanish Chorus)

   Oh, nunca yo podré vivir
    sin mi gran Salvador;
   Le serviré por siempre jamás
   por mostrarme Su amor.
