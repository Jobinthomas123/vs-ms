      |D|
1. A life poured out
            |B|m7         —|D|ma7
    at the Master’s feet;
       |D|               |B|m7
   Forsaking all, His fields
          —|D|maj7
    to reap;
       |D|                 |G|
   And if with tears we sow,
         |A|                  |D|
   The seeds of love will grow—
            |G|      |A|
   We must go and give
                   |D|—|D|7
    our lives for souls.

Chorus:
    |G|         |A|
   We have received so much
          |D|—|B|m
    from Him.
               |E|m7
   How can we hold it back,
      |A|            |D|
   Denying men of life,
                    |D|7
    their souls to win?
        |G|              |A|
   Oh, Jesus gave His life
          |D|            |B|m
    as a willing sacrifice,
       |G|     |A|        |D|    |B|
   To rescue all the perishing
               |G|      |A|        |D|
   From their broken lives of sin.


2. See them grope in obscurity—
   Blindly led by empty dreams.
   But if we dare believe,
   Great glory we shall see;
   For with joy we’ll gather
    in the sheaves.

3. Our cups are full;
    we’re satisfied.
   Our blood-stained hands
    we cannot hide;
   But Christ was crucified,
   That these may be His bride.
   Let’s arise and work before
    the night.

Last Chorus:
   We have received so much
    from Him.
   How can we hold it back,
   Denying men of life,
    their souls to win?
   Oh, we must give our lives
    as a willing sacrifice
   To rescue, now, the perishing
   From their broken lives of sin.
   Let’s rescue all,
    the great and small,
   Rememb’ring where we’ve been.
