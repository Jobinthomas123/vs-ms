   And do what Thou wouldst do.

2. Breathe on me, breath of God,
   Until my heart is pure,
   Until with Thee I will one will,
   To do and to endure.

3. Breathe on me, breath of God,
   Till I am wholly Thine,
   Till all this earthly part of me
   Glows with Thy fire divine.

4. Breathe on me, breath of God,
   So shall I never die,
   But live with Thee the perfect life
   Of Thine eternity.
