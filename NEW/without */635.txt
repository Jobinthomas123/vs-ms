Chorus:
  |E|            |A|
   I love the Lord,
            |E|        |B|
    for He heard my voice;
       |A|        |B|       |E|   —|E|7
   He heard my cry for mercy.

   x2
   |A|               |B|
   I will call on Him
        |G#|        |C#|m
    as long as I live,
      |A|
   Because He turned
        |B|        |E|
    His ear unto me. x2

        |E|        |A|
1. The cords of death,
            |E|
    they entangled me;
       |C#|m              |A|
   The anguish of the grave
           |F#|m  —|B|
    came upon me.
          |E|      |C#|m
   I was so overcome
         |A|           |B|
    by trouble and grief,
          |A|              |B|
   Till I called on the name
            |E|   —|B|
    of the Lord.

2. For You, O Lord,
    have delivered me;
   Your mercy kept my feet
    from falling,
   And my eyes from tears,
   And my soul from near death.
   I will walk before You,
    O my God.

3. What can I do to repay You, Lord,
   For all Your goodness
    upon my life?
   I’ll fulfill all my vows
    and give thanks unto You
   In the midst of Your people,
    O Lord.
