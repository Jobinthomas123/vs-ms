     |D|m
The Day of Christ shall come,
       |C|           |A|
Shall come, shall come.
     |D|m
The Day of Christ shall come,
       |C|           |A|
Shall come, shall come.
     |D|m
The Day of Christ shall come,
    |C|           —|A|
So watch and pray
              |D|m
for it shall come.

      |C|
Then Jesus shall descend
      |D|m
From heaven with a shout,
          |C|
With the voice of an archangel
|D|m
And the trump of God!

We’ll rise together in the clouds
   |G|m    |A|             |D|m
Forevermore with the Lord.

       |C|
Then those dead in Christ
         |D|m
shall arise!
     |C|                        |D|m
And we who are alive shall arise!

Caught up together in the clouds—
   |G|m    |A|              |D|m
Forevermore with the Lord.
