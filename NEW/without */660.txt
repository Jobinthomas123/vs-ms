            |D|m
And, lo, a Lamb stood
            |A|
 upon Mt. Zion
                 |Bb|maj7
With those that follow
              |A|
 where’er He goes.
               |D|m
They have the Father’s name
             |A|
 upon their heads;
                 |A|7
They’ve been redeemed from
             |D|m
 among all men.

                  |G|m
And, they shall lift up their voices,
  |D|m
Crown Him with praises,
|G|m             |A|
Before His throne
   |D|m |C|/|E|  |D|/|F#|
 forev—er—more.
      |G|m
They sing a new song,
    |D|m
A song of redemption,
   |G|m              |A|
Redeemed by the blood
         |D|m
 of the Lamb.

                |D|m
And they shall follow the Lamb,
 |A|
Follow the Lamb,
|Bb|maj7              |A|
Follow where’er He goes!
                |D|m
And they shall follow the Lamb,
 |A|
Follow the Lamb,
|Bb|maj7      |A|    |A|7  |D|m
Follow where’er He goes!
