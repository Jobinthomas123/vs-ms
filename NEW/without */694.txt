1. More love to Thee, O Christ,
      |G|            |A|m7-|D|
    more love to Thee!

   Hear Thou the prayer I make
    |A|m  |C|/|D| |D|   |G|
    on bended knee;
     |C|                 |G|
   This is my earnest plea:
     |D|            |A|m         |G|
    more love, O Christ, to Thee.
    |C|             |G|
   More love to Thee,
    |A|m7    |D|       |G|
    more love to Thee!

2. Once earthly joy I craved,
    sought peace and rest.
   Now Thee alone I seek;
    give what is best.
   This all my prayer shall be:
    more love, O Christ to Thee.
   More love to Thee,
    more love to Thee!

3. Let sorrow do its work;
    send grief and pain.
   Sweet are Thy messengers;
    sweet their refrain,
   When they can sing with me,
    more love, O Christ to Thee,
   More love to Thee,
    more love to Thee!

4. Then shall my latest breath
    whisper Thy praise;
   This be the parting cry
    my heart shall raise;
   This still its prayer shall be:
    more love, O Christ, to Thee,
   More love to Thee,
    more love to Thee!
