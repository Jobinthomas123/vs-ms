            |7|         —|7|7
He gives strength to me
       |0|         —|9|m
 as I worship Him,
        |2|—|2|7
And my heart is filled
       |7|
 with praise.
        |7|
Jesus breaks the bands
       |0|             —|9|m
 as I raise my hands,
            |2|            |7|
And gives glorious victory.
