    D                  Bm
1. Lift your eyes and you will see
    G               Em7
   Fields are ready to be reaped.
    A               A7
   Millions perish without Me.
     G        —Em7
   Who will seek,
                  A4 - A
    for My lost sheep?

Chorus:
    D               Bm
   Not the mighty, not the wise,
    G            Em7
   Not the noble in our eyes,
    A           A7
   But the weak and despised
    G            —Em7
   Have You called,
              A4 - A
   My Lord of all.

2. My sheep are hungry,
    poor and blind;
   Lay down your life
    and you will find
   Your deepest need I’ll satisfy.
   Will you hearken to My cry?

3. My face you’ll see in eternity,
   And your little life shall be to Me
   The song of songs—
    a sweet melody;
   For on Zion’s mount
    you’ll stand with Me.

Last Chorus:
    D               Bm
   Not the mighty, not the wise,
    G            Em7
   Not the noble in our eyes,
   A            A7
   But the weak and despised
    G            —Em7
   Have You called,
       A      D
   My Lord of all.
    Bm                D
   See your calling, brethren!
          A         A7       D
   This great high calling, brethren—
     Bm                   D
   Blessed are they that do His will,
       A                    A7
   For in their heart’s the way
                 D
    to the holy hill!
