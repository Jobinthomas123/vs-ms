    G        D
1. God has a purpose,
        Em         Bm/D
    a place and a time,
        C        G
   When every believer
          Am7   D
    will surely find himself
     G        D
   Painfully yielding,
           Em               F
    for Christ wants His bride
           C           G    D  G –G7
   To be beautifully broken inside.

Chorus:
        C           D
   Oh, how can we know
           G
    the sweetest scent
            C        D         G –G7
   Of the fragrance sealed within;
        C          D    G       Em
   And how can we be a guiding light
          A7 - Am7  D
   If our eye    is dim?

2. Jesus is after the fruit
    in the shell—
   The fruit of the Spirit
    designed to build us.
   But, we’ll never render
    this heavenly prize,
   Till we’re beautifully
    broken inside.

3. Soon the horizon
    will dawn a new day,
   And all imperfection
    will pass away;
   But we must surrender
    till that last trace of pride
   Is so beautifully broken inside.

Ending:
       G            C
   So beautifully broken,
         G          C
   When Jesus has spoken,
        G           D       C—G
   So beautifully broken inside.
