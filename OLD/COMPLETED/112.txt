I want more of Jesus,

More and more and more;
|0|
I want more of Jesus
                   |7|
Than I ever had before.

I want more of His great love—
 |7|*7*                |0|
Rich and full and free.
                |7|
I want more of Jesus,
                  |2|*7*     |7|
So I’ll give Him more of me.
