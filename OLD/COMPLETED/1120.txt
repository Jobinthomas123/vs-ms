*1.* You were the Word

    at the beginning,
            |9|
   One with God,
        |1|*m*        |11|
   The Lord Most High.
|1|*m-*                |11|*/*|1|   |4|
   Your hidden glory in creation
          |9|        |1|*m*        |11|
   Now revealed in You, our Christ.

*Chorus 1:*
                            |4|
   What a beautiful name it is;
                            |11|
   What a beautiful name it is—
               |1|*m*     |11|
   The name of Jesus Christ
         |9|
    my King.
                          |4|*/*|8|
   What a beautiful name it is;
                        |11|
   Nothing compares to this.
                           |1|*m*
   What a beautiful name it is—
        |11|      |9|
   The name of Jesus.

*2.* You didn't want heaven
    without us,
   So, Jesus,
   You brought heaven down.
   My sin was great;
   Your love was greater.
   What could separate us now?

*Chorus 2:*
   What a wonderful name it is;
   What a wonderful name it is—
    The name of Jesus Christ
    my King.
   What a wonderful name it is;
   Nothing compares to this.
   What a wonderful name it is—
    The name of Jesus.


*Bridge:*
                    |9|
   Death could not hold You,
                    |11|
   The veil tore before You,
                    |1|*m7*
   You silenced the boast
               |8|*m7*
    of sin and grave.
                     |9|
   The heavens are roaring
                        |11|
   The praise of Your glory,
                |1|*m7*             |11|
   For You are raised to life again.
                |9|
   You have no rival;
               |11|
   You have no equal.
              |1|*m7*            |8|*m7*
   Now and forever, God, You reign.
                  |9|
   Yours is the kingdom,
                  |11|
   Yours is the glory,
                 |1|*m7*
   Yours is the name
                |11|
    above all names.

*Chorus 3:*
   What a powerful name it is;
   What a powerful name it is—
   The name of Jesus Christ
    my King.
   What a powerful name it is;
   Nothing can stand against.
   What a powerful name it is—
   The name of Jesus.
