Beautiful, beautiful,
 |4|        |9|
Jesus is beautiful.
      |4|            |1|*m7*
And, Jesus makes beautiful
   |6|*m7*       |11|*7*
 things of my life.
 |4|         |11|*7*
Carefully touching me,
 |4|          |9|
Causing my eyes to seeâ€”
 |4|           |1|*m7*
Jesus makes beautiful
   |6|*m7*   |11|*7*  |4|
 things of my life.
