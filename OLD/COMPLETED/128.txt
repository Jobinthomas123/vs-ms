Rejoice in the Lord always,
      |11|*7*             |4|
And again I say, “Rejoice.”

Rejoice in the Lord always,
      |11|*7*             |4|
And again I say, “Rejoice.”
                       |11|*7*
Rejoice, rejoice, and again
            |4|
 I say, “Rejoice.”
                        |11|*7*
Rejoice, rejoice, and again
            |4|
 I say, “Rejoice.”
