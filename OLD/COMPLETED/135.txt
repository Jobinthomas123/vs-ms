Move on, brother,

 move on, sister;
  |0|                 |7|
This is the moving day.
 |0|
Move a little closer;
|5|
Take your stand with Jesus.

Move on, brother, move on.


The move is on, my Lord,
             |7|
 the move is on.
           |7|*7*
The move is on, my Lord,
             |0|
 the move is on.

I hear the rustle
         |5|        |2|*m*
 in the mulberry trees;
    |7|
I know, I know,
                   |0|
I know the move is on.
