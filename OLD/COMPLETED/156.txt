*1.* Have you any room for Jesus,
   |4|*7*                       |9|
   He Who bore your load of sin?

   As He knocks and asks admission,
    |2|       |4|               |9|
   Sinner, will you let Him in?

*Chorus*
    |4|                        |9|
   Room for Jesus, King of glory,
    |2|      |11|*m*             |4|
   Hasten now, His word obey.
     |9|
   Swing your heart’s door
           |2|*-*|11|*m*
    widely open;
    |9|      |4|                |9|
   Bid Him enter while you may.

*2.* Room for pleasure,
    room for business,
   But for Christ the crucified,
   Not a place that He can enter,
   In your heart for which He died!

*3.* Have you any time for Jesus,
   As in grace He calls again?
   Oh, today is time accepted,
   Tomorrow you may call in vain.

*4.* Room and time now give to Jesus;
   Soon will pass God’s day of grace.
   Soon thy heart left cold and silent,
   And thy Savior’s pleading cease.
