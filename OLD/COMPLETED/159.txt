              |9|
*1.* When the trump
                 |2|*/*|9| |9|
    of the great archangel
               |4|           |9|
   Its mighty tones shall sound,
           |4|*7*
   And the end of the world
         |9|
    proclaiming,
          |11|*7*
   Shall pierce the depths
        |4|
    profound,
             |9|
   When the Son of Man
           |2|            |9|
    shall come in His glory,
        |4|*7*                 |9|
   With all the saints on high,
                           |9|*7*
   What a shouting in the skies
              |2|
    from the multitudes that rise—
     |9|              |4|*7*
   Changed in the twinkling
          |9|
    of an eye.


*Chorus*
     |9|
   Changed in the twinkling
          |2|
    of an eye,
     |11|*7*
   Changed in the twinkling
          |4|
    of an eye,
         |9|
   The trumpet shall sound,
         |11|*m*
    the dead shall be raised,
     |4|*7*
   Changed in the twinkling
          |9|
    of an eye.


*2.* When He comes in the clouds
    descending,
   And they who loved Him here,
   From their graves shall awake,
    and praise Him
   With joy and not with fear;
   When the body and the soul
    are united,
   And clothed no more to die,
   What a shouting there will be
    when each other’s face we see—
   Changed in the twinkling
    of an eye.


*3.* Oh, the seed that was sown
    in weakness
   Shall then be raised in pow’r,
   And the songs of the saints
    perfected
   Shall hail that blissful hour.
   When we gather safely home
    in the morning,
   And night’s dark shadow fly,
   What a shouting on the shore
    when we meet to part no more—
   Changed in the twinkling of an eye
