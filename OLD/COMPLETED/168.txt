*1.* Great is Thy faithfulness,

    O God my Father;
     |5|           |0|        |2|*7*
   There is no shadow of turning
          |7|*7*
    with Thee.
                  |0|
   Thou changest not;
                         |2|*m7*
    Thy compassions, they fail not.
   |9|*dim*          |0|
   As Thou hast been
            |7|*7*        |0|
    Thou forever wilt be.

*Chorus:*
     |7|*7*         |5|     |0|
   Great is Thy faithfulness!
     |9|*7*         |2|*m7*
   Great is Thy faithfulness!
    |7|*7*         |0|
   Morning by morning
         |7|*—*|2|*7*      |7|*7*
    new mercies I see.
               |0|
   All I have needed
                     |2|*m7*
    Thy hand hath provided –
   |9|*dim*          |0|
   Great is Thy faithfulness,
     |7|*7*         |0|
    Lord, unto me!

*2.* Summer and winter,
    and springtime and harvest,
   Sun, moon and stars in their
    courses above,
   Join with all nature in
    manifold witness,
   To Thy great faithfulness,
    mercy and love.

*3.* Pardon for sin and a
    peace that endureth,
   Thy own dear presence to cheer
    and to guide;
   Strength for today and bright
    hope for tomorrow,
   Blessings all mine,
    with ten thousand beside!
