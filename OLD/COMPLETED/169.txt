*1.* Now I know Him, my Healer,
        |0|          |7|
    my Savior, and my King,
            |0|            |7|
   And I’m sure that He watches
         |0|
    o’er me.
            |0|             |5|
   He’s my Buckler, High Tower,
             |0|         |7|
    great Jehovah Who healeth;
          |0|
   Every time His grace
      |7|      |0|*-*|0|*7*
    shelters me.

*Chorus:*
     |5|          |0|
   Christ is my way, my goal;
          |5|         |0|     |7|
   I’ve chosen Him as my all.
           |0|           |5|
   What a joy it’s to serve Him,
       |0|             |7|
   To love Him, to please Him;
           |0|      |5|
   I’m a child, child,
      |7|*7*          |0|
    child of His love!

*2.* And, I love Him, my Father,
    my Brother and Leader,
   And I’m sure that He careth
    for me.
   He’s my Shepherd Who feedeth,
    and Redeemer Who knoweth;
   Every step His eye guideth me.

*3.* And, to please Him, my Lover,
    my Friend and Companion,
   And how true that He speaketh
    to me.
   Yes, my pathway shines brighter,
    when eternal my outlook;
   Every hour His love keepeth me.

*4.* And, I fear Him, my Master,
    Instructor Almighty,
   For I’m certain His judgments
    are true.
   Now the saints through all ages
    saw a kingdom for righteous,
   Every one will fear ELOHIM.

*5.* How it thrills me, great service
    my offer to my God,
   For I count it a priv’lege to serve.
   There on Zion the mountain,
   All His servants who followed;
   Everyone He names as His own.
