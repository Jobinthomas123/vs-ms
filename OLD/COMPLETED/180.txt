*1.* Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
        |7|  |2|*/*|6| |4|*m*  |2|     |9|
   And did my  Sov’reign die?
          |2|
   Would he devote that

    sacred head
        |9|            |2|
   For such a worm as I?

*Chorus:*
            |2|
   At the cross, at the cross
            |9|
   Where I first saw the light,
            |9|*7*
   And the burden of my heart
             |2|
    rolled away,
            |7|        |4|*m*
   It was there by faith
         |2|         |11|*m*
    I received my sight,
       |4|*m*       |9|*7*
   And now I am happy
             |2|
    all the day!

*2.* Was it for crimes that I have done,
   He groaned upon the tree?
   Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
   And love beyond degree!

*3.* Well might the sun
    in darkness hide,
   And shut his glories in,
   When Christ, the mighty
    Maker, died
   For man the creature’s sin.

*4.* But drops of grief can ne’er repay
   The debt of love I owe:
   Here, Lord, I give myself away,
   ‘Tis all that I can do!
