*1.* Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
          |9|
   He’ll help you along,
     |2|
    help you along.

   If you will trust His love unfailing,
          |9|         |9|*7*         |2|
   He’ll fill your heart with song.

*Chorus:*
    |2|
   Lean on His arms,
                     |9|
    trusting in His love;
   |9|*7*
   Lean on His arms,
                      |2|
    all His mercies prove.
               |2|*7*
   Lean on His arms,
     |7|             |4|*m*
    looking home above;
         |2|           |9|       |2|
   Just lean on the Savior’s arms.

*2.* Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   He’ll brighten the way,
    brighten the way.
   Just follow gladly
    where He leadeth,
   His gentle voice obey.

*3.* Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   Oh, bring every care,
    bring every care.
   The burden that hath
    seemed so heavy,
   Take to the Lord in prayer.

*4.* Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   Then leave all to Him,
    leave all to Him.
   His heart is full
    of love and mercy,
   His eyes are never dim.

*5.* Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   He meets every need,
    meets every need.
   To all who take Him as a Savior,
   He is a friend indeed!
