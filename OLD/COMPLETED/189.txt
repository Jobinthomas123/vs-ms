*1.* Oh, give me a faith
            |9|
    that is active and patient,
          |2|
   That trusts in Thy power
                     |9|
    to keep me from harm;
       |2|                |7|
   In fiery trials that I may

    be radiant,
         |2|
   And trust in Thy love
            |9|
    and be calm.

*Chorus:*
          |2|
   I’ll trust Thee
     |9|             |2|
    with my whole heart;
                |7|          |2|
   I’ll never from Thee depart.
      |7|
   I know Thou art keeping me
     |2|          |11|*m*
    safe in Thy arms,
           |2|        |9|*7*        |2|
   And I know I’m free from alarms.

*2.* Oh, give me a faith
    that is bold and triumphant
   In perils and sword
    and all famine and pain;
   A faith that is steadfast,
    forever persistent,
   O’er Satan the victory to gain.

*3.* Oh, give me Thy faith, Lord,
    for this I beseech Thee;
   I long to be earnest,
    strong-hearted and true.
   With Thee I shall conquer;
    no evil can touch me.
   My Lord, I shall surely
    win through.

*4.* Assailed by wild tempests
    along my life’s voyage,
   When peace and all safety
    begin to depart;
   Lord, strengthen my faith,
    for Thy Word is my courage;
   And it will a new grace impart.

*5.* Thy faith that is precious
    to me Thou hast given—
   The faith that will master
    the wind and the wave.
   My anchor is cast now
    within the veil riven;
   By Thee I am mighty and brave.
