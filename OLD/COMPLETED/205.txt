         |4|
*1.* Far away in the depths
             |9|      |4|
    of my spirit tonight,

   Rolls a melody
      |6|*7*          |11|*7*
    sweeter than psalm.
         |4|
   In celestial-like strains
          |9|
    it unceasingly falls
            |4|
   O’er my soul like an
    |11|*7*        |4|
    infinite calm.

*Chorus:*
    |4|      |4|*7*
   Peace! Peace!
     |9|         |4|
    Wonderful peace,

   Coming down from
         |6|*7*     |11|*7*
    the Father above,
         |4|         |4|*7*
   Sweep over my spirit
       |4|         |6|*m7*
    forever, I pray,
       |4|          |11|*7*         |4|
   In fathomless billows of love.

*2.* What a treasure I have
    in this wonderful peace
   Buried deep in the
    heart of my soul.
   So secure that no power can
    mine it away,
   While the years of eternity roll.

*3.* I am resting tonight
    in this wonderful peace,
   Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control.
   For I’m kept from all danger
    by night and by day,
   And His glory is flooding my soul.

*4.* And to think when
   I rise to that city of peace,
   Where the Author of peace
    I shall see,
   That one strain of the song
    which the ransomed will sing,
   In that heavenly kingdom shall be.
