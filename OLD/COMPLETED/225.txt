       |7|                 |7|*7*
*1.* I heard an old, old story,
          |0|                 |7|
   How a Savior came from glory,
                            |4|*m*
   How He gave His life on Calvary
       |9|*7*                 |2|
   To save a wretch like me.
      |7|                |7|*7*
   I heard about His groaning,
            |0|                |7|
   Of His precious blood’s atoning.
                   |4|*m*
   Then I repented of my sins
       |9|*m*       |2|    |7|
   And won the victory.

*Chorus:*
     |7|
   O victory in Jesus,
       |0|         |7|
   My Savior, forever;
                     |4|*m*
   He sought me and bought me
         |9|              |2|
   With His redeeming blood.
      |7|
   He loved me ere I knew Him,
       |0|               |7|
   And all my love is due Him.
                     |4|*m*
   He plunged me to victory
      |9|*m*          |2|*7*       |7|
   Beneath the cleansing flood.

*2.* I heard about His healing,
   Of His cleansing pow’r revealing,
   How He made the lame
    to walk again,
   And caused the blind to see.
   And, then I cried, “Dear Jesus,
   Come and heal my broken spirit,”
   And somehow Jesus came
    and brought
   To me the victory.

*3.* I heard about that city
   He is building there in glory,
   And I heard about
    those pearly gates
   Beyond the crystal sea.
   I know that He’s returning—
   Oh, what a blessed hour!
   For on that day I’ll sing up there
   The song of victory.
