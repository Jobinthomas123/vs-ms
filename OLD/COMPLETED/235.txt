*1.* God’s abiding peace
       |7|             |4|*m*
    is in my soul today.
           |9|*m*      |2|
   Yes, I feel it now.
           |7|   |0|   |7|
   Yes, I feel it now;
                 |0|      |7|
   He has taken all my doubts
                |4|*m*
    and fears away,
            |9|*m*     |2|       |7|
   Tho’ I cannot tell you how.

*Chorus:*
          |7|     |0|
   It is mine, mine.
     |7|             |4|*m*
   Blessed be His name!
           |9|*m*     |2|
   He has given peace—
             |7|    |0|  |7|
    perfect peace to me.
                |0|
   It is mine, mine.
     |7|             |4|*m*
   Blessed be His name!
             |9|*m*   |2|   |7|
   Mine for all eternity!

*2.* He has wrought in me
    a sweet and perfect rest;
   In my raptured heart
    I can feel it now.
   He each passing moment
    keeps me sav’d and blest,
   Floods with light
    my heart and brow.

*3.* He has given me
    a never failing joy.
   Oh, I have it now!
   Oh, I have it now!
   To His praise I will
    my ransom’d pow’rs employ
   And renew my grateful vow.

*4.* Oh, the love of God
    is comforting my soul,
   For His love is mine.
   Yes, His love is mine!
   Waves of joy and gladness
    o’er my spirit roll,
   Thrilling me with life divine.
