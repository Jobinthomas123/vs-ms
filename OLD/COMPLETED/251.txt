   “Glory to the newborn King.
                            |4| *–* |11|*7*
   Peace on earth and mercy mild—
            |6|      |11|*–*|6|*-*|11|*7*
   God and sinners reconciled.”

   Joyful, all ye nations, rise,

   “Glory to the newborn King.”

*2.* Christ— by highest heav’n adored,
   Christ—the everlasting Lord.
   Late in time behold Him come,
   Offspring of a virgin’s womb.
   Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
   Hail the incarnate Deity!
   Pleased as man with men to dwell
   Jesus, our Emmanuel.
   Hark! The herald angels sing,
   “Glory to the newborn King.”

*3.* Hail the heav’n-born
   Prince of peace!
   Hail the Sun of righteousness!
   Light and life to all He brings—
   Ris’n with healing in His wings.
   Mild He lays His glory by,
   Born that man no more may die,
   Born to raise the sons of earth,
   Born to give them second birth.
   Hark! The herald angels sing,
   “Glory to the newborn King.”

*4.* Come, Desire of nations, come!
   Fix in us Thy humble home.
   Rise, the woman’s
    conquering Seed;
   Bruise in us the serpent’s head.
   Adam’s likeness now efface;
   Stamp Thine image in its place.
   Second Adam from above,
   Reinstate us in Thy love.
   Hark! The herald angels sing
   “Glory to the newborn King.”
