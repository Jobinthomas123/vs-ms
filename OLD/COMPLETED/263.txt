*1.* My Jesus, may Thy love alone,
         |4|      |1|*m*    |6|*m7-*|11|
   Guide me in pilgrim way.

        |4|        |4|*7*
   Let earthly charms
        |9|      |6|*m7*
    fore’er be gone;
        |4|     |11|*7*     |4|
   Be Thou my only stay.


*2.* Lord, purify my heart and mind.
   That work of grace in me


   *x2*
   Teach me from day
    to day to find,
   Thy matchless love so free.


*3.* Thy faithful Word gives
    life and light
   When Satan’s darts assail.


   *x2*
   Give me the needed
    inward might—
   The joy that will prevail.


*4.* A lasting hope of Zion above—
   My vision make Thou clear.


   *x2*
   O Holy Spirit, gentle Dove,
   Lead Thou me safely there.


*5.* Beneath Thy wings, do shelter
    me—
   My hiding place there sure.


   *x2*
   When night be gone,
    the day I see;
   My anchor is secure.


*6.* A crown of life awaits me there,
   If faithful I shall be.


   *x2*
   And, those who bear
    the cross will share
   Thy throne eternally.
