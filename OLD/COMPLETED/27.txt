I will sing unto the Lord,
    |5|
For He has triumphed

  Gloriously--
     |7|
The horse and rider
                 |0|
Thrown into the sea. *x2*

The Lord my God,

My strength, my song,
     |7|                  |0|
Has now become my victory. *x2*

The Lord is God
    |5|
And I will praise Him,
     |7|
My father’s God
    |0|        |7|
And I will exalt Him.
