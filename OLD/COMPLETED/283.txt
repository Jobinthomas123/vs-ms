*Chorus:*
        |2|        |11|*m*
   He arose! He arose!
         |7|              |9|
   Hallelujah! Christ arose!
            |2|                  |11|*m*
   May the Book of Life never close,
             |4|*m*
   Till the whole world knows,
        |9|
   The whole world knows,
        |2|        |11|*m*
   He arose! He arose!
         |7|              |9|
   Hallelujah! Christ arose!
            |2|                  |11|*m*
   May the Book of Life never close,
              |9|
   Till the whole world knows,
        |9|
   The whole world knows,
        |2|
   He arose!

   |2|              |11|*m*
*1.* Hist’ry began long ago,
  |7|                   |9|
   Many years before man.
    |2|              |11|*m*
   There’s so much we don’t know
  |7|                      |9|
   That went into God’s plan.
            |7|
   Why do stars stay in place
             |6|*m*
    in the heavens?
           |7|      |6|*m*          |7|
   Why do atoms behave as they do?
              |2|
   Yet, what God does reveal,
           |11|*m*
   No one wants to conceal;
            |4|*m*               |9|
   It’s a message great and true.

   Oh! Oh!

*2.* Evil prevailed in the world
    so long.
   What was man to do?
   Then a Man named Jesus
    came along
   With words of life and truth.
   For His love they repaid Him
    with hatred;
   For compassion,
   He hung on the cross.
   Well, it looked like the end,
   To the hope God did send;
   Come at last to a tragic loss?
   No! No!

*3.* No one knows
   when He’s coming again
   Like He said He would.
   He’s just giving us time
    to help mankind
   Receive Him as they should.
   When He comes
    in His beautiful splendor
   And He calls all His own
    to His side,
   I’m so glad I’ll be there.
   There’s no need to despair,
   When in Him you do abide,
    because...
