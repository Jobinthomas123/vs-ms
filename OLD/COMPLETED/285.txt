*1.* Let us search and try our ways
              |7|             |2|
   And turn again unto the Lord;
                       |6|*m*
   Let us lift up our heart
          |9| *–* |4| *–* |9|*7*
    unto God.
            |7|          |9|
   Let us lift up our hands
         |2|           |11|*m*
   Unto God in the heavens
        |2|            |9|       |2|
   And turn to the Lord our God.

*2.* It is of the Lord’s mercies,
   That we are not consumed,
   And because His compassions
    fail not.
   They are new every morning,
   They are new every morning
   And great is Thy faithfulness.
