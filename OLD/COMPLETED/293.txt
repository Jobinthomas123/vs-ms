         |2|                |7|
*1.* I’ve seen the face of Jesus;
        |9|               |2|
   He smiled in love on me.
                           |7|   |4|*m*
   It filled my heart with rapture—
       |9|             |2|
   My soul with ecstasy.
                         |7|
   The scars of deepest anguish
         |9|             |2|
   Were lost in glory bright.
                         |7| |4|*m*
   I’ve seen the face of Jesus,
      |9|               |2|
   It was a wondrous sight.

*Chorus:*
        |2|                 |7|
   Oh, glorious face of beauty,
         |9|              |2|
   Oh, gentle touch of care—
                    |7|   |4|*m*
   If here it is so blessed,
         |9|              |2|
   What will it be up there?

*2.* And, since I’ve seen His beauty,
   All else I count but loss.
   The world, its fame and pleasure,
   Is now to me but dross.
   His light dispelled my darkness;
   His smile was, oh, so sweet.
   I’ve seen the face of Jesus;
   I can but kiss His feet.

*3.* I’ve heard the voice of Jesus;
   He told me of His love
   And called me His own treasure,
   His undefiled, His dove.
   It came like softest music
   Across an ocean calm;
   And seemed to play so sweetly,
   Some wondrous holy psalm.

*4.* I’ve felt the hand of Jesus;
   His touch was, oh, so dear.
   He drew me closer, softly,
   And whispered, “Do not fear”.
   Like clouds before the sunshine,
   My cares have rolled away;
   I’m sitting in His presence,
   It is a brand new day.

*5.* I know He’s coming shortly
   To take us all above;
   We’ll sing redemption’s story,
   The story of His love.
   We’ll hear His voice of music;
   We’ll feel His hand of care.
   He’ll never rest—He says so,
   Until He has us there.
