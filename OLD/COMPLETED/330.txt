*1.* Now, Christ, in Thee
        |7|         |4|*m*
    my soul finds rest
        |7|         |2|       |7|
   When all seems lost to me.
                |0|         |7|    |4|m
   I feared to face the fiery test
         |7|         |9|*7*         |2|
   And sought the world not Thee.

*Chorus:*
    |7|
   Life eternal is in Jesus;
   |0|         |7|                 |2|
   All my springs are now in Thee.
     |7|                        |0| *−* |9|*m*
   There my endless striving ceases
          |7|         |2|*-*|7|
   As I look to Calvary.
                       |0|   |7|
   Love that speaks silently—
              |2|            |7|
   One that brings me liberty.

   How Thy life Thou reckoned not
         |0|      |7|
    for saving me,
                  |2|  |7|
   What a Savior is He!

*2.* When sick and suffering
    unto death,
   I cried in agony,
   Acquainted with my pains,
    Christ saith,
   “I bore the stripes for thee.”

*3.* “Behold, I send the Comforter,”
   Thy parting words they be.
   When He abides there’s nought
    to fear—
   The Father’s gift to me.

*4.* The veil is rent, my anchor’s cast
   In realms of glory great;
   And when my race is run at last,
   A fellow-heir my state.

*5.* My yearning soul doth pine
    for Thee.
   Do hasten, Lord, Thy Day.
   And, when my eyes Thy glory see,
   Great God what shall I say?
