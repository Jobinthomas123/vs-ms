*Chorus:*
   |2|       |4|*m*  |9|         |2|   |11|*m*
   In His time, in His time,
            |4|*m*               |9|*7*
   He makes all things beautiful
            |2|  |2|*7*
    in His time.

                  |7|            |9|
*1.* Lord, please show me every day,
              |6|*m*             |11|*m*
   As You’re teaching me Your way,
            |4|*m*               |9|
   That You do just what You say
            |2|
    in Your time.

*2.* Lord, my life to You I bring;
   You make new of everything;
   Like the blossom of the spring,
    in Your time.

*3.* Lord, I bring to You each tear;
   In my saddest times You’re near.
   When I cry I know You’ll hear
    in Your time.

*4.* Lord, please take me by the hand;
   Help me always understand
   That in my life You have a plan
    in Your time.
