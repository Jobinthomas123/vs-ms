   |7|                   |4|*m*
*1.* The most beautiful song
           |0|                 |2|
   Is the one from Song of songs—
        |7|                      |4|*m*
   The King’s great message of love,
         |0|              |2|
   Far greater than Solomon’s.

*Chorus:*
             |7|            |4|*m*
   For, He planted in my heart
        |0|                 |2|
   The seed of His great love
              |7|            |4|*m*
   That will lead me to perfection,
   |0|               |2|       |7|
   As the sun when fully shone.

*2.* Draw me nigh to You;
   You’re the choice of my heart.
   We’ll run together with gladness,
   For we are united in love.

*3.* Don’t look to me with shame,
   For I am dark and stained.
   But, a King from afar came;
   He found me and loved me the
    same.
