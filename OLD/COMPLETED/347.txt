He that dwelleth
       |9|*m*
In the secret place
         |2|*m7*  |7|
 of the Most High,
 |2|*m7*
Shall abide under the
   |7|*7*             |0|
 shadow of the Almighty.

I will say of the Lord,
   |0|     |9|*m7*
He is my Refuge
  |7|
 and my Fortressâ€”
    |5|                  |0|
My God, in Him will I trust.
