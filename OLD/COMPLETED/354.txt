Thou art my hiding place.
            |4|*m7*     |2|  *—* |11|*m*
Thou art my hiding place;
              |4|*m7*   *—* |9|
Thou shalt preserve me
        |7|   |2|
 from trouble.
  |7|    |9|    |2|*maj7*      |11|*m7*
Thou shalt compass me about
      |4|*m*         |9|   |2|
 with songs of deliverance;
                |4|*m*
What time I am afraid,
|9|                  |2|
 I shall trust in Thee.
