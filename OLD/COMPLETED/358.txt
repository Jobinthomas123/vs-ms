|9|               |2|
*1.* Who shall ascend
              |9|            |2|
    unto the hill of the Lord?
|9|                  |2|
   And who shall stand
                   |4|
    in His holy place?
|9|                      |2|
   He that has clean hands
            |9|       |2|
    and is pure in heart
|9|               |2|             |4|
   And has not lifted up his soul.

*Chorus:*
|6|*m*              |1|*m*
   I dwell in a people
   |2|                        |9|
    whose heart is towards Me—
|6|*m*             |1|*m*
   A people whom I have chosen
   |2|                    |4|
    and called them to Me.

*2.* Who shall abide
    in Your tent, O Lord?
   And who shall dwell
    in Your Holy Hill?
   He who walks upright
    and does righteousness;
   He that speaks the truth
    in his own heart.

*3.* Who shall abide
    under Your wings, O Lord?
   And who shall rest
    in all Your love?
   He that makes the Lord
    his own Refuge and Strength;
   And he who trusts
    with all his heart.

*4.* The Holy One of Israel
    inhabits eternity,
   And He dwells in a high
    and lofty place.
   In them that have a broken,
    contrite, humble heart,
   They’re the ones He chooses
    to dwell on high.

*5.* Behold, the tabernacle
    of God is with man,
   And He will dwell forever
    with them.
   And they shall be His own people;
   God shall be with them
    and be their God.

*(Ending)*
   I dwell in a heart of love;
   I dwell with My dove;
   A people whom I have loved,
    a people for Me.
