             |2|
*1.* You have longed for sweet peace
                        |11|*m*
   And for faith to increase
             |2|
   And have earnestly,
     |9|*7*         |2|
    fervently prayed.

   But you cannot have rest,
                     |11|*m*
    or be perfectly blest
          |2|         |9|*7*        |2|
   Until all on the altar is laid.

*Chorus:*
           |7|         |4|*m*
   Is your all on the altar
        |2|         |11|*m7*
    of sacrifice laid?
         |7|               |4|*7*
   Your heart, does the Spirit
         |9| *-* |9|*7*
    control?
           |2|
   You can only be blest
                             |11|*m*
   And have peace and sweet rest,
            |2|             |9|*7*
   As you yield Him your body
         |2|
    and soul.

*2.* Would you walk with the Lord,
    in the light of His Word,
   And have peace and
    contentment always?
   You must do His sweet will
    to be free from all ill;
   On the altar your all you must lay.

*3.* Oh, we never can know
    what the Lord will bestow
   Of the blessings
    for which we have prayed,
   Till our body and soul
    He doth fully control,
   And our all on the altar is laid.
