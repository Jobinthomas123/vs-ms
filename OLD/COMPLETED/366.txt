*1.* Lord, hear my cry;
        |9|*m*            |0|
    my heart is overwhelmed.
       |5|           |0|
   My enemies are much too strong
        |2|*7*         |7|
    for me to overcome.
       |9|*m*                |9|*m/*|7|
   Oh, no one knows my trouble;
     |5|               |0|
    no one seems to care.
      |9|*m*          |0|
   Attend unto my cry.
      |2|*7*            |7|
    Attend unto my cry.
          |9|*m*            |9|*m/*|7|
   Lord, You are my salvation;
         |5|            |0|
    You are my victory.
      |5|
   I want to praise
           |0|     |7|     |0|
    Your name forevermore.

*Chorus:*
               |5|       |7|
   You are my God, my refuge
              |4|*m7  —*  |9|*m7*
    and my strength—
       |2|*7*
   A stronghold from all
           |7|
    my enemies.
         |9|*m*             |9|*m/*|7|
   Lord, You are my salvation;
        |5|           |0|
   You are my victory;
      |5|
   I want to praise
          |0|      |7|    |0|
    Your name forevermore.

*2.* Lord, let me hear
    the sweet voice of Your love
   Both in the early morning dawn
    and in the darkest night.
   I know that I can trust You
    to keep me till the end.
   I lift my soul to You.
    I lift my soul to You.
   I have no other refuge;
    I have no other help.
   Lord, hide me in
    Your love forevermore.

*3.* Lord, teach me now
    how I can do Your will,
   And make my heart to understand
   The way I am to go.
   Although I’ve often stumbled,
    and many times I’ve failed,
   Please help me to go on.
    Lord, help me to go on.
   It’s not by my own doing,
    I know it’s by Your grace.
   Lord, let me be
    Your servant evermore.

*4.* Lord, let me see
    Your shining face one day—
   The glory of Your countenance,
    the fullness of Your grace.
   This present world is passing;
    I have no portion here.
   Lord, take me to Your land.
    Yes, take me to Your land
   Where life is everlasting,
    pain and crying no more.
   Lord, let me live
    with You forevermore.
