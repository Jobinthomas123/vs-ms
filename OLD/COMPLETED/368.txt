   Of whom shall I now be afraid?

   The Lord is my light
   And is my salvation.
   Whom shall I fear?

*2.* I would have failed,
    unless I had hope
   To see the goodness,
    of the Lord my God.


   In the land, the land
    of the living, the Lord,
   He shall strengthen thine heart.

   I would have failed
    unless I had hope
   To see the goodness,
    of the Lord my God.
