*x2*
  |2|*m*
A song shall be heard

 in the cities of Judah
|7|*m*                       |9|*7*  |2|*m*
And in the streets of Jerusalem.


*x2*
   |5|       |2|*m*
A song of joy,
   |5|        |0|
A song of gladness,
      |7|*m*          |0|*7*
The voice of the Bridegroom,
          |9|*7*            |2|*m*
 and the voice of the bride.
