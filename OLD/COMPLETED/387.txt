*1.* I stand amazed in the presence
       |2|*7*             |7|
    of Jesus the Nazarene
        |0|
   And wonder how He could
     |7|
    love me,
                |2|*7*        |7|
   A sinner condem’d, unclean.

*Chorus:*
    |7|
   How marvellous!

   How wonderful—
    |2|*7*
   And my song shall ever be.
    |7|
   How marvellous! How wonderful
    |9|*m*    |7|            |2|*7*  |7|
   Is my Savior’s love for me.

*2.* For me it was in the garden,
   He pray’d, “Not My will,
    but Thine.”
   He had no tears for His own griefs,
   But sweat drops of blood for mine.

*3.* In pity, angels beheld Him,
   And came from the world of light
   To comfort Him in the sorrows
   He bore for my soul that night.

*4.* He took my sins and my sorrows;
   He made them His very own.
   He bore the burden to Calv’ry
   And suffer’d, and died alone.

*5.* When with the ransom’d in glory
   His face I at last shall see,
   ‘Twill be my joy thro’ the ages,
   To sing of His love for me.
