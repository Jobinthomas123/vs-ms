 |7|
John saw the multitude

  of the overcomers,

And all of them were
                   |2|*7*
  worshipping the Lord.

Some of them were singing,

Some of them were shouting,

But all of them were
                   |7|
  worshipping the Lord.


Oh, praise the Lord!

Oh, praise the Lord!
 |2|*7*                    |7|
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! *x2*
