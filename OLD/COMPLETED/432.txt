    |D|
*1.* Hard times may come
            |G|*6*               |D|
   When I’m walking with my Lord,
                   |F#|*m*
   Feel I’m being swept away
        |A|  |E|*7*    |A|
    by tempest storms.
             |D|                 |D|*7*
   But, my roots deeper they grow
               |G|      |E|*m*
   Planted in Jesus’ love;
    |E|*m7*              |F#|*m*
   Like a tree, I’m standing firm,
       |G|                 |A|
   And I will never be moved.

*Chorus:*
     |D|
   I’m like a tree that’s planted
     |G|        |D|
    by living waters;

   Hard times they may come,
            |E|*7*
   But the Lord will bring me
       |A|
    through.
        |G|               |D|
   Even in the howling desert,
             |E|*m*               |A|
   When all hope is gone it seems –
   |E|*m*
   I am planted
    |G|        |A|          |D|
    by God’s living stream.
          |G|                  |A|
   When heat and dry times come,
       |B|*m*                    |G|
   My leaf stays fresh and green
         |D|      |B|*m*
   ‘Cause I am planted
    |E|*m7*      |A|         |D|
    by God’s living stream.

*2.* Sometimes I pass
   Through a long and lonely night;
   Clouds of darkness hide His
    face—
   No hope in sight;
   But, I’ll wait, patient in hope,
   Holding His promise sure.
   Like the sun
    at dawn breaks through,
   He’ll shine upon me once more!
