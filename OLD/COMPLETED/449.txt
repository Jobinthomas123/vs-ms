  Lord, You know I need
      |E|*m*
   a brand new touch;
|A|                   |G|
  My strength from yesterday
       |D|
   is gone.
                           |D|*7*
  But, if You’ll give me, Lord,
     |E|*m*
   another touch,
|A|*7*                                |D|
  I’ll have the strength to carry on!
