   Thy lovingkindness

   In the morning, O dear Lord.

*Chorus:*
         |B|*/*|A|        |G#|*m7*
   For I flee unto Thee
        |C#|*m*
    to hide me;
  |A|         |B|*7*
   Hide me in Thy presence,
     |E|*—*|B|*m7—*|E|*7*
    Lord.
  |A|        |B|*/*|A|       |G#|*m7*
   For, I flee unto Thee
        |C#|*m*
    to hide me
  |A|        |B|*7*           |E|
   In the secret of Thy love.

*2.* Cause me to know
    the way to walk, Lord;
   Come and take me by my hand.
   Cause me to know
    the way to walk, Lord,
   For I lift my soul to Thee.

*3.* Teach me Thy will,
    and I’ll obey, Lord;
   For Thou art my God and King.
   Teach me Thy will,
    and I’ll obey, Lord;
   Let Thy Spirit take control.
