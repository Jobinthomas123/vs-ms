Blessed is the people that
                  |E|*m7  —*|A|*7*
 know the joyful sound;
           |E|*m*       |A|*7*
They shall walk, O Lord,
                     |D|
 in the light of Thy countenance.
                          |D|*7*
In Thy name shall they rejoice
          |G|
 all the day,
            |D|
And in Thy righteousness
|A|                |D| |D|*7*
 shall they be exalted.

      |G|
For Thou art the glory
             |D|
 of their strength,
                      |B|*7*
And in Thy favor our horn
            |E|*m7* |A|*7*
 shall be exalt—ed;
         |D|             |D|*7*
For the Lord is our defense,
          |G|            |E|*m*
Yes, the Lord is our defense,
         |D|        |A|*7*
And the Holy One of Israel
         |D|
 is our King!
