 |2|        |9|         |7|
Lord, You are more precious
        |2|
  than silver.
          |9|         |7|
Lord, You are more costly
        |9|
  than gold.
 |2|         |9|        |7|
Lord, You are more beautiful
        |2|
  than diamonds,
    |7|           |9|
And all that I desire
               |2|
  is found in You.
