 |9|     |2|                 |11|*m*
Not my will but Thine be done,
          |9|
That the fullness of the Son
     |11|*7*
May dwell within this life
            |4|        |4|*7*
That I have offered Thee.
      |2|           |11|*m*
Until everything I do
              |9|
Becomes the thing
               |6|*m*
 that pleases You,
      |9|              |4|
Abba Father, I would be
            |9|
 Thy son indeed.
