|4|              |4|*7*   |9|
One thing have I desired
          |4|
  of the Lord,
        |1|*m*      |6|*m-*|11|*7*
That will I seek after;
     |4|      |4|*7*           |9|
That I may dwell in the house
          |4|
  of the Lord
         |11|         |4|*-*|4|*7*
All the days of my life;


      |9|
To behold the beauty
          |4|*â€”*|1|*m*
  of the Lord,
      |6|*m*      |11|*7*      |9|*-*|4|
And to inquire in His temple. x2
