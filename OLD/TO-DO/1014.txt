GG7C   G
1. O faithful, pilgrim traveler,
DD7-G
Your journey’s end is closer.
   C  G
The gates of heaven now you see,
  D
And soon you’ll fly
  D/F#
your Lord to meet.
   Em  B/D#
Just keep your eyes upon the Light
Em
That comes from where
A/C#
there is no night,
Cmaj7
That comes from where
   D   G
there is no night.

Chorus:
  DG
 Press on; press on!
  C  D   G
 Press on until you’ve overcome.
  D Em
 Be strong; hold on
 C DG
 ‘til your journey here is done.
   DG
 Press on; press on!
   C D  G
 Press on until the crown is won.
  D Em
 Be strong; hold on
   CD
 ‘til you hear the words
   G
“Well done.”

2.We choose to walk
this narrow road,
For soon ‘twill be a street of gold.
Though trials may come
across our way,
We gladly run on His highway.
Our joy is that
we’ve been redeemed,
So on we go towards
glory’s stream.
So on we go towards
glory’s stream.

3.Our labors here are not in vain,
Though oft’ it seems
the prize is pain.
But man’s applause is not our aim;
We’re only longing for that day
When Jesus gathers all His saints,
And with this hope
we will not faint.
And with this hope
we will not faint.
