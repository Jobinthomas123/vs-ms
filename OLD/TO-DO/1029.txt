1.There is a hope
 DmC/E  F2
that burns within my heart,
  Dm7/F-C/E  Dm7
That gives me strength
C/EF2   Gsus4-G
for ev’ry   passing day;
   F/A   G/B   C
A glimpse of glory
Dm   C/E   F2-G Am7
now revealed in meager part,
   C/E   Dsus4-D Gsus4-G
Yet drives all doubtaway.
 Am7 Em/G
I stand in Christ,
F   G/F  C/E
with sins forgiv’n;
Dm7E/G#
And Christ in me,
Am7 - G/B - C
the hope  of   heav’n!
Dm  C/EF2
My  highest calling
 C/G-E/G#-Am7
and my deepestjoy–
F C/G   G   Csus4-C2
To make His will my home.

2.There is a hope
that lifts my weary head,
A consolation strong against despair,
That when the world
has plunged me in its deepest pit,
I find the Savior there!
Through present sufferings,
future's fear,
He whispers, “Courage,”
in my ear.
For I am safe in everlasting arms,
And they will lead me home.

3.There is a hope
that stands the test of time,
That lifts my eyes
beyond the beck’ning grave,
To see the matchless
beauty of a day divine
When I behold His face!
When sufferings cease
and sorrows die,
And every longing satisfied,
Then joy unspeakable will flood
my soul,
For I am truly home.
