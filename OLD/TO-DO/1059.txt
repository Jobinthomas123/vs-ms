Who's my righteousness,

Singing praises to the Lord

I make my heart His rest.

Who has brought me peace,
Giving Him my life and all
My will I find release.

Who poured out His life;
Willingly I take hold on
The place of sacrifice.

His habitation;
I will praise Him all my days
And then in holy Zion.
