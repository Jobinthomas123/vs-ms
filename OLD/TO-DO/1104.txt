 G
1.There’s a country far beyond

the starry sky;
 D7
There’s a city where there
G
never comes a night.
 C
If we’re faithful we shall go there
   G
by and by;
 Am  D7
'Tis the city where the Lamb
 G
is the light.

Chorus:
G  C/D
In that city where the Lamb
 G
is the light,
Em  A7
The city where there cometh
 D
no night.
  C
I will dwell with Jesus there,
 GEm
And when free from toil and care,
Am D7
I am going where the Lamb
 G
is the light.

2.Here we have our days
of sunshine, but we know
That the sun which shines upon us
now so bright,
Will be changed to clouds and rain
until we go
To the city where the Lamb
is the light.

3.There the flowers bloom
forever and the day
Shall be one eternal day
without a night;
And our tears shall be
forever wiped away,
In that city where the Lamb
is the light.

4.Here we have our disappointments
all the while,
And our fondest hopes but meet
with bitter blight.
Tho’ by night we weep,
the morning brings a smile,
In that city where the Lamb
is the light.

5.Then let sunlight fade,
let twilight bring its gloom,
Not a shadow can my blissful
soul affright;
For I know that up in heaven
there is room,
In that city where the Lamb
is the light.
