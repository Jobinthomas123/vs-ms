  Em Am
1.O holy Lamb of God—
   CBmEm
Most precious sacrifice,
   C  Em
Pure, perfect, sinless life,
  D  B7
The blood which will suffice,
   Am   D
Who could have paid
Em   — C — D
a higher price?

Chorus:
EmAm  — C
It was for me
 D Em
Those nails were driven.
EmAm  — C
It was for me
D Em
Cruel stripes were given.
   B7Em  B7   Em
All for me, all for me
  C D   Em
His side was riven.
B7  Em
What great price
  B7  Em
He paid for my life—
  C   DEm
My sins to be forgiven.

2.The blood of bulls and goats
Could not for sin atone;
Great king from highest heav’n
Must leave His glorious throne.
He came to bear
my sins alone.

3.He bore reproach and shame
Upon dark Calvary’s tree—
Bruised, mocked, despised of men,
For all the world to see,
Enduring all
to set me free.

4.No greater love than this
When Christ was crucified,
Willingly He gave His life
That we may be His bride,
Forever, always
by His side.
