1.How deep the Father’s
   A   F#m7
love for us,
   E   C#m F#m - B7
How vast beyond all measure,
EA  F#m7
That He should give His only Son
   E C#m   B-E
To make a wretch His treasure.
  E
How great the pain
A  F#m
of searing loss;
EC#m   F#m  B7
The Father turns His face away
  E
As wounds which mar
   A F#m7
the Chosen One
 EC#m  B-E
Bring many sons to glory.

2.Behold the Man upon a cross,
My sin upon His shoulders;
Ashamed,
I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers.
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished.
His dying breath
has brought me life;
I know that it is finished.

3.I will not boast in anything—
No gifts, no power, no wisdom;
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
Why should I gain
from His reward?
I cannot give an answer,
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.
