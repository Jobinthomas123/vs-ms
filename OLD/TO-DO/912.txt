1. Soon the Lord of glory
A7   Dm
will come—what blest morning!
   A
We do watch and pray,
A/C#Dm
waiting for that day
CBb
When we will rise
 A Dm
to meet Him in the skies.

Chorus:
D7/F# GmC
We’ll bow before Him,
FDm
and we’ll worship Him,
   Gm   A
Rejoice and evermore
Dm-D/F#
proclaim
  Gm   C
The work of glory
 FDm
and His wondrous grace
 GmA Dm
Shown forth in us that day.

2.Holy is Mount Zion,
the Lord’s habitation;
New Jerusalem,
where God dwells with men—
And in that place
one day with Him we’ll reign.
