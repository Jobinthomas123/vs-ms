C G/B
1.You created the world
  F/AC/E
with the mention of one word,
 F
And with Your touch
Dm   G
it all came to be.
   C  G/B
Everything that was done
  F/A  C/E
went according to Your plan;
   Dm
Because of that
   G
weâ€™ll never doubt Your power.

Chorus:
   C
May my lips never cease
C/F   F
to praise You;
 F/G   G
May my heart only beat
 C
to live for You.
  Am
May the last breath that I breathe
 F Fm
be for You alone.
F/A  G/B
With every thought I think,
FG
With every deed I do,
   DmG
May my life only be
   C
to please You.

2.The future of my life
is written in Your book;
My every thought
and prayer is known by You.
All of my needs
by You have been supplied;
My life is incomplete
without Your love.
