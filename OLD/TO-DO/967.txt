1.Hide me now
Dm D/F#G
Under Your wings.
C/EF
Cover me
DmG
Within Your mighty hand.

Chorus:
C/E   F
When the oceans rise
  GC
and thunders roar,
C/E F
I will soar with You
 GAm
above the storm.
 C/EF
Father, You are King
   G  Csus4
over the flood;
C/E  F
I will be still
 G  C
and know You are God.

2.Find rest, my soul,
In Christ alone.
Know His power
In quietness and trust.
