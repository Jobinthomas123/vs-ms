         |2|        |7|
I will enter His gates
              |2|
  with thanksgiving in my heart;
                  |7|
I will enter His courts
         |9|
  with praise.
        |2|               |7|
I will say this is the day
            |2|        |11|m
  that the Lord has made;
   |4|m
I will rejoice
       |9|               |2|
  for He has made me glad.

                 |7|
He has made me glad.
|2|                |11|m
He has made me glad;
   |4|m
I will rejoice
      |9|                |2|
  for He has made me glad x2
