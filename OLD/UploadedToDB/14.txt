 |2|           |2|7
Hallelujah! Jesus loves me.
 |7|           |2|      |9|
Hallelujah! Jesus loves me,
 |2|           |7|            |2|-|9|
Not for any reason I can see.
|2|             |2|7
Even though I often stumble,
   |7|                |2|
He takes me by the hand,
                   |9|
And He leadeth me on
           |2|
  to victory!
