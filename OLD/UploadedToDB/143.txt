|7|
 I’ve been redeemed

  by the blood of the Lamb.
               |2|
 I’ve been redeemed
                       |7|
  by the blood of the Lamb.
               |0|
 I’ve been redeemed
                        |9|m
  by the blood of the Lamb;
                   |7|
 Filled with the Holy Ghost
     |4|m
  I am.
        |9|m                 |2|7
 All my sins are washed away;
               |0|—|7|
 I’ve been redeemed.
