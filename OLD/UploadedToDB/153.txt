         |9|        |9|7
1. On a hill far away
             |2|            |11|7
    stood an old rugged cross,
      |4|7
   The emblem of suff’ring,
          |9|
    and shame.
                          |9|7
   And, I love that old cross
               |2|           |11|7
    where the Dearest and Best,
          |4|
   For a world of lost sinners
          |9|
    was slain.

Chorus
            |11|m7         |4|7
   So, I’ll cherish the old
             |9|—|9|7
    rugged cross
             |2|
   Till my trophies
        |11|m7        |9|  –|4|7
    at last I lay down.
            |9|          |9|7
   I will cling to the old
              |2|—|11|m7
    rugged cross,
           |9|           |4|7
   And exchange it someday
            |9|
    for a crown.

2. Oh, that old rugged cross
    so despised by the world,
   Has a wondrous attraction for me.
   For, the dear Lamb of God
    left His glory above,
   To bear it to dark Calvary.

3. In the old rugged cross
    stained with blood so divine,
   A wondrous beauty I see.
   For, ‘twas on that old cross
    Jesus suffered and died,
   To pardon and sanctify me.

4. To the old rugged cross
    I will ever be true,
   Its shame and reproach
    gladly bear.
   Then He’ll call me some day
    to my home far away,
   Where His glory forever I’ll share.
