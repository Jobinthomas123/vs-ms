1. O Lord, my God,
               |2|       |11|m —|11|m7
    when I in awesome wonder
            |9|        |4|
   Consider all the worlds
         |4|7         |9|
    Thy hands have made;
 |4|             |9|
   I see the stars,
               |2|         |11|m—|11|m7
    I hear the rolling thunder,
                    |9|
   Thy power throughout
         |4|    |4|7      |9|
    the universe displayed.

Chorus
 |4|                |9|—|9|7
   Then sings my soul,
        |2|      |11|m      |9|—|6|m
    my Savior God to Thee;
                  |11|m7
   How great Thou art!
 |4|                 |9|  |4|
   How great Thou art!
                  |9|—|9|7
   Then sings my soul,
        |2|      |11|m7     |9|—|6|m
    my Savior God to Thee;
                  |11|m7
   How great Thou art!
 |4|                |9|
   How great Thou art!

2. When through the woods and
    forest glades I wander,
   And hear the birds
    sing sweetly in the trees,
   When I look down from
    lofty mountain grandeur,
   And hear the brook
    and feel the gentle breeze.

3. And when I think that God,
    His Son not sparing,
   Sent Him to die,
    I scarce can take it in—
   That on the cross,
    my burden gladly bearing,
   He bled and died
    to take away my sin.

4. When Christ shall come
    with shout of acclamation,
   And take me home,
    what joy shall fill my heart.
   Then I shall bow
    in humble adoration,
   And there proclaim: “My God,
    How great Thou art!”
