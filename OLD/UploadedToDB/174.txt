1. There’s a blessed time
                    |7|      |0|
    that’s coming, coming soon;
                       |9|m
   It may be evening, morning
           |2|m-|7|
    or at noon—
        |0|               |0|7
   The wedding of the bride
      |5|               |0|
    united with the Groom.

   We shall see the King
      |7|      |0|
    when He comes.

Chorus:
    |0|
   We shall see the King!

   We shall see the King!
                     |7|
   We shall see the King
      |2|      |7|-|2|7-|7|7
    when He comes.
         |0|
   He’s coming in power;
          |5|                |0|
   We’ll hail the blessed hour.

   We shall see the King
      |7|      |0|
    when He comes.

2. Are you ready should
    the Savior call today?
   Would Jesus say, “Well done,”
    or “Go away”?
   “My home is for the pure,
    the vile can never stay!”
   We shall see the King
    when He comes.

3. Oh, my brother, are you
    ready for the call
   To crown your Savior
    King and Lord of all?
   The kingdoms of this world
    shall soon before Him fall;
   We shall see the King
    when He comes.
