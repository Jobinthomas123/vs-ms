1. When we walk with the Lord

   In the light of His Word,
            |7|        |2|
   What a glory He sheds
            |9|7
    on our way!
             |2|
   While we do His good will,

   He abides with us still,
            |7|
   And with all who will
      |2|       |9|7-|2|
    trust and obey.

Chorus:
     |9|        |9|7-|2|
   Trust and obey,
                 |11|7      |4|m
    for there’s no other way
          |9|7       |2|
   To be happy in Jesus
                |7|   |9|7-|2|
   But to trust and obey.

2. Not a shadow can rise,
   Not a cloud in the skies,
   But His smile quickly
    drives it away.
   Not a doubt or a fear,
   Not a sigh or a tear,
   Can abide while we
    trust and obey.

3. Not a burden we bear,
   Not a sorrow we share,
   But our toil He doth richly repay.
   Not a grief or a loss,
   Not a frown or a cross,
   But is blest if we trust and obey.

4. But we never can prove
   The delights of His love
   Until all on the altar we lay.
   For the favor He shows,
   And the joy He bestows
   Are for them who will
    trust and obey.

5. Then in fellowship sweet
   We will sit at His feet,
   Or we’ll walk by His side
    in the way.
   What He says we will do;
   Where He sends we will go.
   Never fear, only trust and obey.
