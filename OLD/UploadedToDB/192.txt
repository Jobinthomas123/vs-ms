Chorus:
        |2|m
   The Lord is my strength and song
               - |0|  |10|  |0| - |2|m
   And He is become my salvation!

   He is my God and I will

    prepare Him an habitation.
       |9|7
   My father’s God and
             |2|m
    I will exalt Him!

   |7|m                 |2|m
1. He hath triumphed gloriously;
                         |2|7
   I will sing unto the Lord.
   |7|m                  |2|m
   He hath triumphed gloriously;
        |9|7
   The horse and his rider

   Hath He cast into the sea.

2. The Lord is a Man of war;
   The Lord is His name.
   Pharaoh’s chariots and his host
   He cast in the depths of the sea!

3. Thy right hand, O Lord,
   Is become glorious in pow’r;
   Thy right hand, O Lord,
   Hath cast in pieces the enemy.

4. Who is like unto Thee,
   O Lord, among the gods?
   Who is like Thee,
    glorious in holiness,
   Fearful in praises
    doing wonders?
