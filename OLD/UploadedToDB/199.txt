    |2|           |9|    |2|
1. Jesus loves me, this I know,
    |7|                   |2|
   For the Bible tells me so.
                |9|  |2|
   Little ones to Him belong;
     |7|       |2|           |9|     |2|
   They are weak, but He is strong.

Chorus:
    |2|          |7|
   Yes, Jesus loves me.
   |2|                 |9|
   Yes, Jesus loves me.
    |2|          |7|
   Yes, Jesus loves me;
        |2|           |9|  |2|
   The Bible tells me so.

2. Jesus loves me, He Who died,
   Heaven’s gate to open wide.
   He will wash away my sin;
   Let His little child come in.

3. Jesus loves me, loves me still,
   Though I’m very weak and ill.
   From His shining Throne on high,
   Comes to watch me where I lie.

4. Jesus loves me; He will stay
   Close beside me all the way.
   If I love Him, when I die,
   He will take me home on high.
