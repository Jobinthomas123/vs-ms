1. My hope is built
                |11|7
    on nothing less
         |9|
   Than Jesus’ blood
         |4|   |11|7   |4|
    and righteousness;

   I dare not trust
          |11|7
    the sweetest frame
         |9|
   But wholly lean on
     |4| |11|7   |4|
    Jesus’ name.

Chorus:
         |4|               |9|
   On Christ, the solid Rock,

    I stand;
       |4|
   All other ground is
             |11|7
    sinking sand.
       |4|
   All other ground is
     |11|7      |4|
    sinking sand.

2. When darkness seems
    to hide His face,
   I rest on His unchanging grace;
   In ev’ry high and stormy gale,
   My anchor holds within the veil.

3. His oath, His covenant, His blood,
   Support me in the whelming flood;
   When all around
    my soul gives way,
   He then is all my hope and stay.

4. When He shall come
    with trumpet sound,
   Oh, may I then in Him be found;
   Dressed in His
    righteousness alone,
   Faultless to stand
    before the throne.
