2. Magnify the Lord, our God,
    for His sovereign grace.
   Jesus Christ, the bleeding Lamb,
    died for Adam’s race.
   By faith we’re saved and justified,
   Grace of Christ the crucified,
   We shall soon be glorified,
   So praise His name.

3. Magnify the Lord, our God,
    for His faithful Word.
   Precious is the Word of truth—
    Spirit’s sharpest sword.
   Upon His Word, the Rock,
    we stand,
   Saved from every sinking sand,
   Looking for the Promised Land,
   So praise His name.

4. Magnify the Lord, our God,
    for His power great.
   Heav’n and earth were
    by Him made—
   Christ the Potentate.
   His power hath raised us
    from the dead,
   We are by His Spirit led,
   Held by Him Who is the Head,
   So praise His name.
