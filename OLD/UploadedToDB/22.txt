If that same Spirit
                             |7|
That raised Christ from the dead
          |7|7            |0|
Dwell in you, dwell in you;

If that same Spirit
                             |7|
That raised Christ from the dead
          |7|7            |0|
Dwell in you, dwell in you;
               |5|
Then He shall quicken
               |0|
  your mortal bodies,
          |7|7             |0|
If that Spirit dwell in you.
              |5|
And He shall quicken
               |0|
  your mortal bodies,
          |7|7            |0|
If that Spirit dwell in you.
