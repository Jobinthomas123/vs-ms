Chorus:
     |4|
   Spirit of God coming down

    from heaven

   Like a little white dove
          |6|      |11|7
    so fresh and free.
    |4|
   Heavenly Father, send the
     |9|     |4|
    Holy Spirit like a
    |9|            |4|
   Little white dove,
              |11|7     |4|
    come and baptize me.

         |4|
1. When Jesus was baptized
            |9|     |4|
    in the River Jordan,

   The Holy Spirit came
     |6|         |11|7
    down from above.
        |4|
   The heavens were opened
             |9|        |4|
    as the Spirit descended;

   It rested upon Him
                    |11|7   |4|
    like a little white dove.

2. Now Jesus, He promised
    that He’d never leave us;
   Our comfort would come from His
    Spirit of love.
   He promised He’d send us
    down His spiritual power
   After He ascended to
    His Father above.
