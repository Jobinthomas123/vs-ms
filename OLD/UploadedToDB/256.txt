1. Away in a manger,
        |9|         |4|
   No crib for a bed,
       |11|7
   The little Lord Jesus
                        |4|
   Laid down His sweet head.
                      |4|7
   The stars in the sky
           |9|            |4|
   Looked down where He layâ€”
        |11|7          |4|
   The little Lord Jesus,
      |11|7          |4|
   Asleep on the hay.

2. The cattle are lowing;
   The Baby awakes,
   But little Lord Jesus,
   No crying He makes.
   I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
   Look down from the sky,
   And stay by my cradle
   Till morning is nigh.

3. Be near me, Lord Jesus,
   I ask Thee to stay
   Close by me forever
   And love me, I pray.
   Bless all the dear children
   In Thy tender care,
   And take us to heaven
   To live with Thee there.
