2. Willing to die for your sins
    and your shame,
   I laid aside all
    My glory and fame
   That you may be saved
    in My precious name,

3. If you’ll forsake all
    your ambition vain,
   Crowning Me King
    in Your own life to reign,
   All that is Mine will be your
    heav’nly gain.
   Who will now follow
    to serve Me today?

4. All throne, dominion
    and power are Mine;
   Father hath placed Me
    on Zion to reign.
   My servants true
    will with Me rule and shine.
   Who will now follow
    to serve Me today?

5. Yes, where I am,
    there My servants shall be—
   Perfectly one
    with Us, the Trinity;
   They shall have access
    to God’s mystery.
   Who will now follow
    to serve Me today?
