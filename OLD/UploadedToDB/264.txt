1. I am the Bread of Life;
           |0|
   He who comes to me
               |2|
    shall not hunger.
             |7|
   He who believes in Me
      |11|m7       |0|
    shall not thirst.
    |7|                 |0|
   No one can come to Me
     |9|m                |2|
   Unless the Father draw him.

Chorus:
               |7|-|2|      |7|
   And, I will raise him up.
               |0|-|7|      |2|
   And, I will raise him up.
               |7|-|4|m     |0|
   And, I will raise him up
   |9|m     |7|-|2|    |7|
   On the last day.

2. The bread that I will give
   Is My flesh for the life
    of the world,
   And he who eats of this bread,
   He shall live forever,
   He shall live forever.

3. Unless you eat of the flesh
    of the Son of Man
   And drink of His blood,
   And drink of His blood,
   You shall not have life within you.

4. I am the Resurrection,
   And I am the Life.
   He who believes in Me,
   Even if he die,
   He shall live forever.
