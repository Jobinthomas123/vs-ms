1. Oh, what a wonderful,

    wonderful day—
                       |11|7
   Day I will never forget.
   |6|m
   After I’d wandered
       |11|7
    in darkness away,
                        |4|
   Jesus, my Savior, I met.

   Oh, what a tender,

    compassionate friend;
   |4|7                     |9|
   He met the need of my heart.

   Shadows dispelling,
          |4|
    with joy I am telling,
      |11|7                       |4|
   He made all the darkness depart!

Chorus:
    |4|           |1|m
   Heaven came down,
        |6|m  |11|7        |4|
   And glory filled my soul,
                 |1|m
   When at the cross
      |6|m    |11|7       |4|
   My Savior made me whole.
     |6|m               |6|m7
   My sins were washed away,
          |4|          |7|
   And my night was turned
        |1|m - |9|dim
    to day;
    |4|           |1|m
   Heaven came down,
        |6|m  |11|7         |4|
   And glory filled my soul.

2. Born of the Spirit,
    with life from above,
   Into God’s family divine.
   Justified fully through
    Calvary’s love,
   Oh, what a standing is mine.
   And, the transaction
    so quickly was made,
   When as a sinner I came—
   Took of the offer of grace
   He did proffer, He saved me,
   Oh, praise His dear name!

3. Now I’ve a hope
   that will surely endure
   After the passing of time;
   I have a future in heaven for sure,
   There in those mansions sublime.
   And, it’s because of
    the wonderful day
   When at the cross I believed.
   Riches eternal
    and blessings supernal,
   From His precious hand
    I received.
