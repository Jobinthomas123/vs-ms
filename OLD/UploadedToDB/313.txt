1. As the mountains are around
      |7|    |0|
    Jerusalem,
        |2|m
   The Lord is all around
        |4|m  |9|m
    His people.


Chorus:
         |7|          |9|m
   From this time forth
           |7|   |9|m
    and forevermore,
           |2|m
   Oh, the Lord is all around
        |4|m   |9|m
    His people.
         |7|          |9|m
   From this time forth
            |7|       |9|m
    it will always be;
       |2|m
   The Lord is all around
        |4|m   |9|m
    His people.

2. Like Mount Zion in the midst
    of Jerusalem,
   We cannot be moved,
   We cannot be moved.
