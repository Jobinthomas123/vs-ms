1. In our soul there’s joyful hope
            |0|      |9|m7     |7|
   When we look up to the sky
                     |4|m
   Knowing that the coming
            |9|               |2|
    of our Lord is drawing nigh.
        |0|                 |2|
   His mercy, faith, and love and
             |7|              |4|m
    grace uphold us in the race;
        |7|            |9|m7
   Our longing is to see Him
     |2|       |7|
    face to face.

Chorus:
    |0|                  |2|
   Come back quickly, Lord!
          |7|              |4|m
   We’re waiting day and night—
    |7|            |4|m
   Loving Your appearing
          |9|7            |2|
   Your presence our delight.
       |0|               |2|
   To see You face to face,
       |7|              |4|m
   To sit with You on high;
    ||G                  ||Am7
   Come back quickly, Lord,
     ||D         ||G
    for Your bride!

2. We’re pilgrims, strangers
    on this earth—
   No place to lay our head.
   But, faces pointed to the Lamb,
    and by His Spirit led;
   Holding fast our confidence,
    inheritance divine;
   Still running, although
    others may resign.

3. His hinds’ feet He has given us
    upon the mountain hills—
   Filling us with rapturous joy,
    as valleys He now fills.
   Maranatha is our prayer—
    our blessed hope’s reward.
   Make haste, oh tarry not,
    beloved Lord!

4. Although the way seem
    steep and high
   That leads to blessed end—
   Travelling through paths untrod,
    oft times without a friend.
   His love is burning in our hearts,
    and draws us day by day;
   His rod and staff do keep us
    in the way!

5. Our living hope grows brighter
   As we reach that perfect day.
   Our body will be raptured from
    the grasp of death’s decay.
   Exceeding joy will catch us up
    to glorious throne above
   Where we shall see Him
    face to face in love.
