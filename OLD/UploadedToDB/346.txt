 |4|            |11|7
1. Direct my heart, O Lord,
    |9|      |9|m             |4|
   Into devoted love for You.
               |11|7
   Let every thought of mine
         |9|
    be stayed on You—
      |9|m                 |4|
   A love steadfast and true.

Chorus:
 |9|                 |11|7
   For, You’re my God and King,
 |6|m         |11|7
   Master of everything,
 |6|m                 |11|7
   And unto You, my Lord,
              |4|
    do I now sing.
 |9|                |11|7
   Yes, You’re my God and King,
 |6|m         |11|7
   Master of everything,
 |6|m                |11|7
   And unto You my life
              |4|
    do I now bring.

2. O Lord, take every idol
    from my heart;
   I’ll not from You depart.
   Your love on Calvary
    constrains me to
   Draw closer unto You.

3. I want to serve You now,
    Lord, faithfully,
   I’ll by Your mercies be
   A vessel just for You.
    I’ll be Your own
   My heart shall be Your throne.

4. I lift my soul, O Father,
    unto You;
   Your mercies they are new.
   I want to walk with You,
    so take my hand;
   I’ll be at Your command.

5. Tie me with bands of love;
    they will suffice.
   I’ll be Your sacrifice,
   For on Your altar,
    My High Priest and King,
   I surrender everything.
