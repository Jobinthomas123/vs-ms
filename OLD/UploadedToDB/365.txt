1. All to Jesus I surrender;
   |5|              |7|     |0|
   All to Him I freely give.
                |7|
   I will ever love and trust Him—
    |5|              |7|      |0|
   In His service daily live.

Chorus:
   |0|          |2|m7    |7|7          |0|
   I surrender all,  I surrender all.
                     |0|7     |5|
   All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
   |0|        |7|  |0|
   I surrender all.

2. All to Jesus I surrender;
   Humbly at His feet I bow.
   Worldly pleasure all forsaken—
   Take me, Jesus, take me now.

3. All to Jesus I surrender;
   Make me, Savior, wholly Thine.
   Let me feel the Holy Spirit—
   Truly know that Thou art mine.

4. All to Jesus I surrender,
   Lord, I give myself to Thee.
   Fill me with Thy love and power;
   Let Thy blessing fall on me.

5. All to Jesus I surrender;
   Now I feel the sacred flame.
   Oh, the joy of full salvation—
   Glory, glory to His name.
