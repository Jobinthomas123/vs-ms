1. Blessed be the Lord, my Strength,
           |5|        |0|        |2|m
   Who’ll teach my hands to war
                  |7|m             |9|7
   And train my fingers how to fight.
|2|m
   Cast forth Your lightning, Lord;
         |5|     |0|    |2|m
    destroy my enemies.
                  |7|m
   Shoot out Your arrows;
              |9|7
    scatter them.

Chorus:
        |7|m          |0|
   My Goodness, my Fortress,
        |2|m
   My Deliverer and Shield,
       |0|                 |2|m
   My Lord God in whom I trust;
       |7|m           |0|
   My Goodness, my Fortress,
         |2|m            |10|
   High Tower and my Shield,
       |7|m7  |0|             |2|m
   My Lord God in whom I trust.

2. Bow down Your heavens, Lord,
   And make the mountains smoke.
   Send from above
    Your mighty hand;
   Deliver me from evil.
   God rescue me,
   And save me from
    the hurtful sword.

3. I’ll sing a new song unto Thee,
    O Lord my God;
   With music I will praise
    Thy name.
   Happy is that people, yes,
    whose God is the Lord—
   Who sing His praises evermore.
