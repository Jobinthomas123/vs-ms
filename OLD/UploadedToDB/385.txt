He poured in the oil and the wine,
                            |7|
The kind that restoreth my soul.
              |0|           |0|7
He found me bleeding and dying
        |5|        |0|
 on the Jericho road,
                     |7|
And He poured in the oil
          |0| – |5| – |0|
 and the wine.
