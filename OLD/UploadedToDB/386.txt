   Blessed Jesus,
    |6|m           |11|m
   Savior of our soul,
   |2|-|11|m  |4|m7 |9|7    |2|
   Be exalted evermore.

2. Open our ears and speak peace
    to our soul;
   Let healing flow,
    oh, make our body whole.
   Calm ev’ry fear, and
    each troubled heart console;
   Lord, draw us, much closer
    to Thee.

   Jesus, Thy blood gives us
    boldness to come.
   Sin’s debt is paid;
    salvation’s work is done.
   Battle’s been fought,
    and the victory is won
   Forever and evermore!

3. Once we were blind;
    now Thy beauty we see.
   Glory divine, O holy Majesty!
   Make Thy face shine
    upon us eternally;
   Don’t leave us, Lord Jesus,
    please stay.

   Oh, what a joy to be here
    with Thee, Lord—
   One family gathered
    in one accord.
   Fellowship sweet in Thy kingdom
    —our reward,
   Together, forever with Thee!
