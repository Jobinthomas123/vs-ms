1. I have found a friend in Jesus;
         |9|              |4|
    He’s everything to me.
             |4|                |1|m7
   He’s the fairest of ten thousand
          |6|m7 – |11|7
    to my soul.
        |4|          |4|7
   The Lily of the valley,
        |9|           |4|
    in Him alone I see,

   All I need to cleanse
         |11|7             |4|  —|4|7
    and make me fully whole.
       |9|              |6|m
   In sorrow He’s my comfort,
         |4|
    in trouble He’s my stay;
                     |1|m7
   He tells me ev’ry care
              |6|m7 – |11|7
    on Him to roll.

Chorus:
             |4|           |4|7
   He’s the Lily of the valley,
         |9|                   |4|
    the Bright and Morning Star;
                             |11|7
   He’s the fairest of ten thousand
           |4|
    to my soul.

2. He all my grief has taken
    and all my sorrows borne;
   In temptation He’s my strong
    and mighty tow’r.
   I have all for Him forsaken
    and all my idols torn
   From my heart, and now
    He keeps me by His pow’r.
   Though all the world forsake me,
    and Satan tempts me sore,
   Through Jesus I shall safely
    reach the goal.

3. He will never, never leave me
    nor yet forsake me here
   While I live by faith and do His
    blessed will.
   A wall of fire about me,
    I’ve nothing now to fear,
   With His manna He my hungry
    soul shall fill.
   Then sweeping up to glory,
    to see His blessed face
   Where rivers of delight
    shall ever roll!
