We need new showers of the rain

That You’ve promised
         |11|m — |9|
 now to send.

     |2|              |9|
Oh, pour out Your Spirit
         |7|             |9|
 like a mighty river, Lord,
      |2|             |9|
And come with Your power—
            |7|           |9| – |9|7
 all Your glory now restore.
