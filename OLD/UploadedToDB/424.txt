1. How I praise You,
      |4|m        |9|m
    praise You Lord,
    |0|       |2|     |4|m
   Rock of my salvation.
           |2|           |4|m       |9|m
   You I praise from shore to shore
    |0|       |2|    |4|m
   In all Your creation.
            |0|    |2|   |4|m       |2|
   Let it ring from mountain tops,
        |4|m     |2|          |0| â€”|2|
   And let my voice proclaim
         |4|m    |2|      |4|m     |9|m
   The tender mercies of my Lord,
       |0|   |2|      |4|m
   Yeshua is His name.

2. Messiah of Israel is He,
   Restorer of our nation.
   The hope of David now we see,
   Bringing us salvation.
   Root of Jesse, Lion of Judah,
   Judge of Israel,
   Now we praise You for Your joy,
   The love that never fails.
