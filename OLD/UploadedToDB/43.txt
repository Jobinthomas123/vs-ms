All over the world
               |7|7
The Spirit is moving.

All over the world

As the prophets said
            |0|
  it would be;

All over the world
                      |5|
Thereâ€™s a mighty revelation
                     |0|
Of the glory of the Lord,
       |7|7                |0|
As the waters cover the sea.
