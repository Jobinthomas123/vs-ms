   again;
    |5|          |7|     |0|
  Please Your work revive.
|4|7                     |9|m
  Blow through like a mighty wind;
      |2|7                   |7|
  Descend with tongues of fire.
  |0|  |7|        |5|      |0|
  Let Living Waters flow;
   |5|         |7|        |9|m
  Fill our thirsting souls.
   |5|      |7|         |0|
  Baptize each and every one
    |7|7             |0|
   with the Holy Ghost.
