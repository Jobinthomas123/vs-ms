        |2|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.
                       |9|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.
                       |9|7
With a heart of thanksgiving,
                       |2|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.

With my hands lifted up,
                           |9|
And my mouth filled with praise,
                       |9|7
With a heart of thanksgiving,
                       |2|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.
