 My heart is thrilled
      |2|m7              |5| |0|
  wheneâ€™er I think of Jesus,
               |7|7
 That blessed name
                           |0|
  that sets the captives free.
            |5|
 The only name through which
                |0|
  I find salvation,
          |7|7
 No other name has meant
              |0|
  so much to me.
