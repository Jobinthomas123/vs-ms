Dm-                Gm
1. I cannot come before
C-                    F
   A righteous, holy Lord
Dm-                  Gm
   And offer to Him worldly things
    F/C       C
   I do not need
       C/Bb        Bb
   And hope He's pleased.
Dm-                    Gm
   For He wants me to give
C-                       F
   A heart that's truly His—
Dm-               Gm
   An offering of highest price:
     F/C      C      C/Bb     Bb
   A servant who the Lord can use.

Chorus:
                  Gm         C
   And I will not offer anything
                  F
   That costs me nothing;
                Bb/D             C/E
   I'll place before Him nothing less
            F
   Then my very best.
      C/E      Dm             C
   And if I'm called to sacrifice
               Bb           F/A
   It will be worthy of my Christ;
              Gm         C
   I will not offer anything
                  Fsus4-F
   That costs me nothing.

2. To serve Him is my goal.
   How could I withhold?
   Whatever's mine He's given me;
   It's not my own,
   It's His alone.
   Whatever He requires,
   That is my desire;
   Whatever He may need from me,
   I'll pay the cost—
   Gain or loss.
