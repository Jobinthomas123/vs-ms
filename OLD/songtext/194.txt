                  D
1. Sound of His trumpet,
                    A
    thrilling with rapture,
                D
   Ushers the Bridegroom
     E7     A
    to us again.
                   D
   All through the ages,
               A
    patiently waited,
                   D
   Some are now “sleeping”,
    A         D
    others remain.

Chorus:
    D7        G
   Heavenly Bridegroom!
              D
   Heavenly Bridegroom!
                 Bm
   Welcome my Savior,
     E7           A
    hail Thee, my King!
        D              A
   Hallelujah! I am rejoicing!
              D       A
   Singing I go like birds
            D
    on the wing.

2. Just like a thief
    Thou comest for treasure;
   Saints from the earth
    transported shall be.
   Angels from heaven,
    muster with trumpets,
   Echoing anthems sweetly of Thee.

3. Radiant with glory,
    Star of the morning,
   Fairest of thousands, lovable He;
   Higher than heavens,
    honored by Father,
   This is the Lamb slain,
    even for me.

4. Saints who are sleeping
    rise in a twinkling,
   Rising immortal caught up
    to Thee.
   Oh, what a gathering!
   Some from all nations
   Meeting with Jesus in secrecy.

5. There up in heaven,
    saints for enthroning,
   Eagerly angels wait for that day.
   bride in her garments,
    shining white linen,
   Honored by Savior—
    this is her day.
