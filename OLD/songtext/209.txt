1. Magnify the Lord, our God;
      B7
    praise His wondrous name.
    A                   B7
   Lift your voice and sing, O saints,
    F#               B7
    of His glorious fame!
       E
   In tenderness He reached

    our hearts,
   A                F#m
   Out of hell our souls He brought,
   E
   On the cross this vict’ry’s

    wrought,
              B7   E
   So praise His name.

Chorus:

   Praise the Lord—

    rejoicing  in His matchless love,

   Praise the Lord—
                         B7
    for every blessing from above;
    E
   Praise the Lord
          E7
    all great and small,
  A                   B7
   At His feet let’s humbly fall,

2. Magnify the Lord, our God,
    for His sovereign grace.
   Jesus Christ, the bleeding Lamb,
    died for Adam’s race.
   By faith we’re saved and justified,
   Grace of Christ the crucified,
   We shall soon be glorified,
   So praise His name.

3. Magnify the Lord, our God,
    for His faithful Word.
   Precious is the Word of truth—
    Spirit’s sharpest sword.
   Upon His Word, the Rock,
    we stand,
   Saved from every sinking sand,
   Looking for the Promised Land,
   So praise His name.

4. Magnify the Lord, our God,
    for His power great.
   Heav’n and earth were
    by Him made—
   Christ the Potentate.
   His power hath raised us
    from the dead,
   We are by His Spirit led,
   Held by Him Who is the Head,
   So praise His name.
