1. To God be the glory;
            D             G
    great things He hath done.
       C            G
   So loved He the world
             A7          D
    that He gave us His Son,
         G
   Who yielded His life
         D            G
    an atonement for sin,
       C            G
   And opened the life gate
                  D G
    that all may go in.

Chorus:
               G
   Praise the Lord!

   Praise the Lord!
                           D
   Let the earth hear His voice.
               D7
   Praise the Lord!

   Praise the Lord!
                     G
   Let the people rejoice.

   Oh, come to the Father
           D         G
    thro’ Jesus the Son,
        C             G
   And give Him the glory;
                     D    G
    great things He hath done.

2. Oh, perfect redemption,
    the purchase of blood,
   To ev’ry believer
    the promise of God;
   The vilest offender
    who truly believes,
   That moment from Jesus
    a pardon receives.

3. Great things He hath taught us;
    great things He hath done,
   And great our rejoicing
    thro’ Jesus the Son.
   But, purer and higher
    and greater will be
   Our wonder, our transport
    when Jesus we see.
