|C|
I will sing unto the Lord,
    |F|
For He has triumphed

  Gloriously--
     |G|
The horse and rider
                 |C|
Thrown into the sea. *x2*


     |C|       |F|
The Lord my God,

My strength, my song,
     |G|                  |C|
Has now become my victory. *x2*


     |C|
The Lord is God
    |F|
And I will praise Him,
     |G|
My father’s God
    |C|        |G|
And I will exalt Him.

     |C|
The Lord is God
    |F|
And I will praise Him,
    |G|
My father’s God
             |C|
And I will exalt Him.
