1. O watchful pilgrim,
     F         C
    lift your voice,
                             G7
   For joy cometh in the morning;
          C
   Break forth in joy
         F       C
    and publish peace,
                          G7 C
   For joy cometh in the morning.

Chorus:
   G7                 C
   Joy cometh in the morning!
    F                 C
   Joy cometh in the morning!
                   F          Dm7
   Suff’ring may endure for a night,
        C                G7  C
   But joy cometh in the morning!

2. Say, “Tempest tossed,
    be comforted”,
   For joy cometh in the morning.
   When least esteemed and buffeted,
   Say, “Joy cometh in the morning!”

3. Oh, glorious freedom to His sons
   When joy cometh in the morning.
   From labors they may ever rest,
   For joy cometh in the morning.

4. Oh, say, “Rejoice!”
    Thou bride of Christ!
   Thy joy cometh in the morning.
   Adorn thyself with righteousness;
   Thy joy cometh in the morning.

5. This Lamb that’s worthy
    once was slain.
   True joy cometh in the morning.
   On throne of God He doth now sit;
   Our joy cometh in the morning.
