  |A|
Thou hast turned my mourning

  into dancing for me;
                           |E|*7*
Thou hast put off my sackcloth.

Thou hast turned my mourning

  into dancing for me
                     |D|  |A|
And girded me with gladness.

To the end that my glory

  may sing praise to Thee
            |D|
And not be silent;
  |B|*m*        |A|
O Lord, my God, I will give
    |E|                 |D|*-*|A|
  thanks unto Thee forever.
