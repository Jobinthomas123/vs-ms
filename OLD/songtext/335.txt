   |C|       |G|*/*|B|       |A|*m*
*1.* Only in God is my soul
           |A|*m/*|G|
    now at rest;
       |F|        |G|      |C|
   In Him comes my salvation.
             |G|*/*|B|       |A|*m*
   Only the Lord is my refuge
          |A|*m/*|G|
    and rock,
          |F|        |G|      |C|
   My strength and my salvation.

*Chorus:*
         |F|             |A|*m*
   My stronghold, my Savior,
   |F|        |G|      |A|*m*
   I shall not be afraid at all;
         |F|            |A|*m*
   My stronghold, my Savior,
   |F|        |G|       |C|
   I shall not be moved.

*2.* Only in God is found safety
    and peace
   When I’m pursued by the enemy.
   Only in God is found glory
    and grace
   When I’m found meek
    and found lowly.
