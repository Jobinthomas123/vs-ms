*Chorus:*
      |D|           —|E|*m*
   A Song of songs,
             |F#|*m*        |G|   *—*|E|*m*
   A song of joy to my heart,
              |A|*7*           |D|
   A song of praise to my God,
                 *—*|E|*m*
   A song of hope,
              |F#|*m*         |G|   *—*|E|*m*
   A song of faith to my Love,
                |A|*7*            |D|
   A song of rejoicing to my King.

         |E|*m*           |F#|*m*   |G|
*1.* Draw me and let us run alone;
 |E|*m*                  |A|
   Bring me to the chambers
             |D|
    of Your love.
 |G|           |A|              |F#|*m*
   I will remember all Your love
               |B|*m*
    more than wine.
 |E|*m*                       |A|
   Let Him kiss with the kisses
            |D|   *—-*|D|*7*
    of His love.
 |G|                  |A|
   Behold, You are fair my Love
          |F#|*m*           |B|*m*
    and pleasant to my eyes,
 |E|*m*          |A|                    |D|
   I will rejoice and be glad in You.

*2.* Listen, the voice of my Love
    from the hills,
   With joy He is coming forth
    to me.
   He said, “Arise My love
    and come away with Me,
   O My dove, My undefiled,
    My love.
   The time of the singing of the
    birds has come to us;
   Arise My love and come away
    with Me.”

*3.* My Love has gone to His
    garden of love;
   A garden enclosed is where
    He feeds.
   Set me as a seal upon
    Your heart forevermore;
   Many waters can never quench
    our love.
   I am Your beloved and I know
    that You are mine.
   Let me dwell forever in Your love.
