*1.* Jesus, be the Lord of all.
   |A|*7*             |G|      |D|
   Jesus, be the Lord of all.
                  |G|      |E|*m*
   Jesus, be the Lord of all
        |G|       |A|      |D|
   The kingdoms of my heart.


*x2*
*Chorus:*
            |E|*m*
   For, if You’re not Lord
       |A|
    of everything,
         |E|*m*         |A|     |D|
   Then You’re not Lord at all.


*2.* Jesus, I surrender all....
*3.* Jesus, come and conquer all...
