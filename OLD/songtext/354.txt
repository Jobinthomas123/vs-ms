            |E|*m7*     |D|  *—* |B|*m*
Thou art my hiding place;
              |E|*m7*   *—* |A|
Thou shalt preserve me
        |G|   |D|
 from trouble.
  |G|    |A|    |D|*maj7*      |B|*m7*
Thou shalt compass me about
      |E|*m*         |A|   |D|
 with songs of deliverance;
                |E|*m*
What time I am afraid,
|A|                  |D|
 I shall trust in Thee.
