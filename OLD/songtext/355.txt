   |G|                        |C|    |G|
*1.* Years I spent in vanity and pride,
    |D|     |D|*7*                |G|*-*|C|*-*|G|
   Caring not my Lord was crucified,
            |C|             |G|
   Knowing not it was for me
       |E|*m7*      |A|*m7-*|D|*-*|G|
    He died on Calvary.

*Chorus:*
    |C|      |A|*m7*
   Mercy there was great,
          |G|        |E|*m7*
    and grace was free;
    |D|       |D|*7*             |G|   |C|  |G|
   Pardon there was multiplied to me.
     |C|       |A|*m7*
   There my burdened soul
           |G| |E|*m7*     |A|*m7-*|D|*-*|G|
    found liberty at Calvary.

*2.* By God’s Word at last
    my sin I learned.
   Then I trembled at the Law
    I’d spurned,
   Till my guilty soul imploring
    turned to Calvary.

*3.* Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus
    ev’rything;
   Now I gladly own Him
    as my King.
   Now my raptured soul
    can only sing of Calvary.

*4.* Oh, the love that drew
    salvation’s plan!
   Oh, the grace that brought it
    down to man!
   Oh, the mighty gulf that God
    did span at Calvary!
