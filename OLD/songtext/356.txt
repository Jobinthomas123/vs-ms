    |A|
*1.* Christ’s coming now is nearing—
     |D|           |B|*m*
   Blest day of His appearing.
    |A|               |F#|*m*
   This thought my heart
                 |B|*m*   *—*|E|
    great joy affords.
     |A|
   His saints around are sighing—
    |D|          |B|*m*
   For this release are crying,
     |A|           |E|
   “Hasten Thy glorious coming,
     |A|
    Lord!”

*Chorus:*
    |A|
   Jesus is coming soon,
     |D|        |B|*m*
    coming I know—
    |E|           |E|*7*
   Coming His glorious bride
         |A|   *—*|E|
    to claim.
    |A|
   With rapt’rous hearts

    we’re waiting
    |D|             |B|*m*
   To join that grand translating.
      |A|          |E|
   “Hasten Thy glorious coming,
     |A|
    Lord!”

*2.* Sorrow and sin prevaileth,
   In pain the earth travaileth,
   Darkness abounds in ev’ry land.
   But, in earth’s darkest hour
   He’ll come in mighty power.
   “Hasten Thy glorious coming,
    Lord!”

*3.* He warns us to be watching,
   Praying and always ready.
   We do not know the day nor hour.
   Are you your hearts preparing
   Ascension robes, now wearing,
   Washed in the blood of Calv’ry’s
    Lamb?

*4.* So, when the trumpet soundeth
   And He from heav’n descendeth
   To claim the church,
    His spotless bride;
   With boundless joy
    We’ll greet Him,
   As we arise to meet Him.
   “Hasten Thy glorious coming,
    Lord!”
