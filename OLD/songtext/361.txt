1.Loved with everlasting love,
   Bm  E7A
Led by grace that love to know,
 D  Bm G  D
Spirit, breathing from above,
 E7  A
Thou hast taught me it is so!
 G F#m   Em AD
Oh, this full and perfect peace!
   G  F#m Em A
Oh, this transport all divine!

G   F#mEm AD
In a love which cannot cease
   Bm   Em  A D
I am His and He is mine. x2

2.Things that once were wild alarms,
Cannot now disturb my rest—
Closed in everlasting arms,
Pillowed on the loving breast.
Oh, to lie forever here,
Doubt and care and self resign

While He whispers in my ear.
I am His, and He is mine. x2

3.His forever, only His—
Who the Lord and me shall part?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart!
Heaven and earth may fade
and flee,
Firstborn light in gloom decline,

But while God and I shall be
I am His and He is mine. x2
