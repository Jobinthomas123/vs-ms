 |G|            |D|*7*     |G| *—* |G|*7*
His name is Jesus, Jesus,
 |C|          |G|       |D|*7*
Sad hearts weep no more.
        |G|
He has healed
              |G|*7*
  the broken-hearted,
        |C|               |A|*m7*
Opened wide the prison doors,
         |D|*7*
And He’s able to deliver
        |G|
  evermore.
