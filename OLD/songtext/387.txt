G
1.I stand amazed in the presence
 D7  G
of Jesus the Nazarene
  C
And wonder how He could
 G
love me,
 D7   G
A sinner condem’d, unclean.

Chorus:
   G
How marvellous!

How wonderful—
   D7
And my song shall ever be.
   G
How marvellous! How wonderful
  Am   GD7  G
Is my Savior’s love for me.

2.For me it was in the garden,
He pray’d, “Not My will,
but Thine.”
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat drops of blood for mine.

3.In pity, angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

4.He took my sins and my sorrows;
He made them His very own.
He bore the burden to Calv’ry
And suffer’d, and died alone.

5.When with the ransom’d in glory
His face I at last shall see,
‘Twill be my joy thro’ the ages,
To sing of His love for me.
