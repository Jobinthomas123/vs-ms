C Em/B
1.As the deer pants
 Am  Am/G
 for the waters,
F
So my soul longs
   G   C – G4-G
 after You;
   C  Em/B Am  Am/G
You alone are my heart’s desire,
F  G C
And I long to worship You.

Chorus:
  Am F
You alone are my Strength,
   C
 my Shield;
  F   Dm
To You alone
  Dm7   E7
 may my spirit  yield.
  C   Em/B Am   Am/G
You alone are my heart’s desire,
   F   G C
And I long to worship You.

2.I want You more than
gold or silver;
Only You can satisfy.
Flowing down like a mighty river,
Lord, Your love lifts me on high.

3.You’re my Friend, and
You are my Brother
Even though You are the King;
I want You more than any other,
So much more than anything.
