Chorus:
  D Bm
Therefore, my brethren,
G A
Be strong in the Lord;
   D   Bm
Take up your armor,
G   A
And take up your sword.
   D Bm
Don’t get caught up
 G  A
In th’ affairs of this life,
D  Bm
But fight the good fight
  G – A  D
As a true soldier of Christ.

   G  A
1.For, we wrestle not
   D   Bm
Against flesh and blood
 G   A
But with powers of darkness
   D   Bm
And rulers thereof.
   G  A
Take unto you all
  D   Bm
The armor of God,
 G A
And having done all,
  G  A   D
Stand and fight for the Lord.

2.So gird up your loins
With truth now and stand;
Let your feet so be shod
With the Gospel of peace.
Put on the breastplate
Of His righteousness,
And you’ll have the victory,
And nothing less.

3.Above everything,
Take your shield of faith,
And you’ll quench fiery darts
Of the one that we hate.
Salvation’s helmet
You must put on now,
And take up the sword
Which is the Word of God.
