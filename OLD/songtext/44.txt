         |C|
Surely goodness and mercy
                         |G|
Shall follow me all the days,
           |G|*7*         |C|
  all the days of my life.

Surely goodness and mercy
                         |G|
Shall follow me all the days,
           |G|*7*         |C|
  all the days of my life.
             |F|
And I will dwell in the house
          |C|
  of the Lord forever,
            |D|*7*
And I will feast at the table
              |G|*7*
  spread for me.
        |C|
Surely goodness and mercy
                         |G|
Shall follow me all the days,
           |G|*7*         |C|
  all the days of my life.
