Chorus:
G C G—C   G
It won’t be long ‘til we see Jesus;
Am – D7
It won’t be long
G
‘til we’ll be with Him!
C G—CG
It won’t be long  ‘til we see Jesus;
Am – D7
It won’t be long
  G
‘til we see Him face to face!

   Am   D7
1.Yes, there are many mansions
   C  G
in My Father’s house, it’s true,
   Am   D7
But I will now prepare
 G G7
 a place especially for you.
 C  A
If you, as a faithful bride,
   G  E7
will watch and wait for Me,
 Am   D7
I’ll return to catch you away
 C
That where I am,
   G
there you may be.

2.All of creation’s groaning,
for it’s longing to be free;
And all of heaven’s waiting
for that glorious liberty.
Lift your eyes and lift your head;
it is so plain to see
That salvation’s closer today
Compared to when you first
believed.

3.Yes, there are many trials,
But My grace will see you
through
If you will fully trust that
what I promised I will do.
Don’t let Satan take away
your faith so dear to Me;
Overcome him that you may
Reign upon My throne eternally.
