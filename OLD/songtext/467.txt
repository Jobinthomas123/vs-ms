E  E2
1.I look up to the mountains;
Amaj7 E
to the hills I turn my eyes.

Who will come to help me,
 E4   E  B
oh, where am I to hide?
E   E2
The One who made the heavens
   E7   A—F#m
and earth will hear my call;
   E  E2
The Lord will come to help me,
   B  A   E
and He will not let me fall.

Chorus:
 E
He will not let you fall.
  A   E
He will not let you fall.

He is never weary, and
   B   A E
He will not let you fall. x2

2.The One Who watches Israel
ever will His vigil keep,
Through the burning sunlight
and in the darkness deep.
He’s constantly beside you;
you need not fear at all.
The Lord is there to help you,
and He will not let you fall.

3.So when you are in danger,
when by trouble you are found,
Your very soul is threatened
by evil all around;
In all your ways He’s with you,
in troubles great and small,
Now and ever after,
He will not let you fall.
