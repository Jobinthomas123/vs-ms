1.Is there a mountain in your way?

Do doubts and fears abound?

Press on, oh, hear the Spirit say,
E7 A7
“This mountain shall come down!”

“It’s not by might,

It’s not by pow’r,

But by My Spirit,”

2.Is there a river in your path—
A river deep and wide?
Step in, the waters will roll back,
You’ll reach the other side.

3.Is there a fiery furnace trial,
Far more than you can bear?
Behold the blessed Son of God,
Is walking with you there.

4.Then trust alone the mighty God,
He speaks, the winds obey;
Take courage, then,
O fainting heart,
For you He’ll make a way.
