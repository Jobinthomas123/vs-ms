Looking for some willing men

His plea—

Showing them the millions of

hungry, dying souls,

Fields for harvest waiting now,

but no one wants to go.

2.Harvest fields are white,
but laborers are few.
Who will now be ready
to hold His banner true?
Going forth with precious seed—
the Living Word of God,
Following, with many tears,
the hard path Jesus trod.
