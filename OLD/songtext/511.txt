Chorus:
E E4 E
Happy is the one whose sin
A-B
freely is forgiven,
   E
Whose innocence
 E4 E
has been declared
C#m  G#m7 F#m7-B-E
By the Lord of   heaven.

 G#m7  A2
1.I cried till I could cry no more,
G#m7  A2
my guilt in me remained;
D   A/C#
I fell beneath the burning sun
  D   B
Till forgiveness brought the rain.

2.And when I let my heart
be known
And my confession made,
Oh, then I saw Your mercy come,
Come to take my guilt away.

3.O people, let your voice be heard
in prayer before your God!
For, He alone can rescue you
From all trouble like a flood.
