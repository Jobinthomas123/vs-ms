Dear Jesus, sweet Jesus,
        |D|         |G|
What a wonder You are;
         |D|
You’re brighter than
       |B|*m*       |E|*m—*|A|
  the morning star.
        |D|            |G|
You’re fairer, much fairer,
          |D|
Than the lily that grows
          |G|
  by the wayside,
  |D|              |A|*7*
Precious, more precious
        |D|*—*|D|*7*
  than gold.
             |G|        |E|*m*
You are the Rose of Sharon,
     |D|
The fairest of the fair,

You are all my heart
               |E|*m—*|A|*7*
  could e’er desire.
      |D|            |G|
Dear Jesus, sweet Jesus,
        |D|         |G|
What a wonder You are;
         |D|
You’re precious,
       |A|*7*           |D|
More precious than gold.
