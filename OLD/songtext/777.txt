   C
1.When upon life’s billows
 G7
you are tempest-tossed,

When you are discouraged,
CG7  C
thinking all  is  lost,

Count your many blessings;
   F
name them one by one,
   G
And it will surprise you
C  G7  C
what the Lord hath done.

Chorus:
   C
Count your blessings;
   Dm
name them one by one.
 G
Count your blessings;
C
see what God hath done.
 F
Count your blessings;
 G   C
name them one by one,
F
And it will surprise you
G   C
what the Lord hath done.

2.Are you ever burdened
with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings ;
every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing
as the days go by.

3.When you look at others
with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised
you His wealth untold.
Count your many blessings;
money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven,
nor your home on high.

4.So amid the conflict,
whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged;
God is over all.
Count your many blessings;
angels will attend—
Help and comfort give you
to your journey’s end.
