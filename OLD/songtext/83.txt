One thing have I desired
          |E|
  of the Lord,
        |C#|*m*      |F#|*m-*|B|*7*
That will I seek after;
     |E|      |E|*7*           |A|
That I may dwell in the house
          |E|
  of the Lord
         |B|         |E|*-*|E|*7*
All the days of my life;


      |A|
To behold the beauty
          |E|*â€”*|C#|*m*
  of the Lord,
      |F#|*m*      |B|*7*      |A|*-*|E|
And to inquire in His temple. x2
