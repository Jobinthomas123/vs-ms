|C|      |E|*m*            |F|
If My people who are called
         |C|
 by My name
      |F|          |C|
Will humble themselves
       |D|*m-*|G|
 and pray,
    |F|        |E|*m*
And seek My face,
     |D|*m*                 |G|*7*  |C|
And turn from their wicked ways;
                       |E|*m*
Then will I hear from heaven,
               |F|
Forgive their sin,
                |D|*m7*
And heal their land.
       |C|
If My people will
  |D|*m7*              |G|     |C|
 humble themselves and pray.
