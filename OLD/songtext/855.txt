I find rest in Your presence

And fullness of joy.

In worship and wonder
  E  F#m
I behold Your face,

Singing,

“What a faithful God have I!”

What a faithful God have I—

Faithful in every way!

2.Lord of mercy, You have
heard my cry;
Through the storm
You’re the Beacon—
My Song in the night.
In the shelter of Your wings
hear my heart’s reply,
Singing,
“What a faithful God have I!”

3.Lord all sovereign, granting
peace from heav’n;
Let me comfort those who suffer
With the comfort You have giv’n.
I will tell of Your great love
for as long as I live,
Singing,
“What a faithful God have I!”
