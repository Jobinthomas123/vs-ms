Nothing in this world
 D  Dsus
can satisfy me.
  D A/C# G/B   D/A  CA7
Jesus, You alone can fill me up.

I could gain the world
 DDsus
and all its treasures,
D  A/C#
But all those things
  G/BD/AC  A7
would never be enough.

   D
It is Your love,
   Em
It is Your goodness,
   D/F#  G
It is Your kindness
   D/F#
And compassion
GD   G -A
That fill me up inside.
  D
It is Your grace,
Em
Your tender mercies,
  D/F#   GA7
It is Your presence in my life
   D
that satisfies.
