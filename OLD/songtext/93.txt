        |G|
Fill my cup, Lord;
               |D|
I lift it up, Lord.
         |A|*m*           |D|*7*
Come and quench this thirsting
        |G|
 of my soul;
          |G|        |G|*7*
Bread of heaven, feed me
         |C|       |A|*m*
 till I want no more.
        |D|            |D|*7*
Fill my cup; fill it up
               |G|
 and make me whole.
