Won’t you greet somebody
     |5| |7|    |0|
 in Jesus’ name?

Won’t you tell them

That you love them
     |5| |7|    |0|
 in Jesus’ name?

Tell them we can work together
    |5|  |7|    |0|
 in Jesus’ name.

            |7|
Everybody smile –
      |5|      |0|
Jesus loves you.
            |7|
Everybody smile –
      |5|      |0|
Jesus loves you.
