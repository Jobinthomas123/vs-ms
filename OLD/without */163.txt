1. I’d rather have Jesus
         |5|          |0|
    than silver or gold;

   I’d rather be His
                        |7|-|7|7
    than have riches untold.
        |0|          |0|7
   I’d rather have Jesus
          |5|         |0|
    than houses or lands;

   I’d rather be led
                 |7|       |0|
    by His nail-pierced hand.

Chorus
            |7|    |7|7
   Than to be a king
          |5|     |0|
    of a vast domain,
           |7|
   And be held
        |7|7           |5|—|0|
    in sin’s dread sway;
       |0|            |0|7
   I’d rather have Jesus
         |5|    |0|
    than anything
                |7|        |0|
   This world affords today.

2. He’s fairer than lilies of rarest hue;
   He’s sweeter than honey
    that’s out of the comb.
   He’s all that my hungering
    spirit needs;
   I’d rather have Jesus
    and let Him lead.

3. I’d rather have Jesus
    than men’s applause;
   I’d rather be faithful
    to His dear cross.
   I’d rather have Jesus
    than worldwide fame;
   I’d rather be true
    to His holy name.
