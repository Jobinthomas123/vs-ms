1. I traveled down a lonely road,
        |5|      |5|m        |0|
   And no one seemed to care.
                     |9|m
   The burden on my weary back
        |2|7             |7|
   Had bowed me to despair.

   I oft complained to Jesus
        |5|           |5|m      |0|
   How folks were treating me,

   And then I heard Him say
        |7|     |0|-|0|7
    so tenderly,
         |5|             |2|m7
   “My feet were also weary
     |0|
   Upon the Calv’ry road,
         |5|              |2|m7
   The cross became so heavy,
     |2|7                |7|
   I fell beneath the load.
       |0|               |0|7
   Be faithful, weary pilgrim
        |5|             |0|
   The morning I can see.

   Just lift your cross
                |7|      |0|
   And follow close to Me.”

2. “I work so hard for Jesus”,
   I often boast and say.
   “I’ve sacrificed a lot of things
   To walk the narrow way;
   I gave up fame and fortune,
   I’m worth a lot to Thee.”
   And then I hear Him gently
    say to me,
   “I left the throne of glory
   And counted it but loss;
   My hands were nailed in anger
   Upon a cruel cross.
   But now we’ll make the journey
   With your hand safe in Mine;
   So lift your cross
   And follow close to Me.”

3. Oh, Jesus, if I die upon
   A foreign field some day,
   ’Twould be no more
    than love demands—
   No less could I repay.
   “No greater love hath mortal man
   Than for a friend to die.”
   These are the words He gently
    spoke to me.
   “If just a cup of water
   I place within your hand,
   Then just a cup of water
   Is all that I demand.”
   But, if by death to living
   They can Thy glory see,
   I’ll take my cross
   And follow close to Thee.
