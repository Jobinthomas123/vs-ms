1. Let me walk alone with Thee,

   Through the vale

    and o’er the height,
                |5|
   Through the dark
                |2|m7       |7|
    and in the light evermore.
             |0|
   Whom love I on earth but Thee?

   Whom have I in heaven
          |5|
    but Thee?
             |0|                  |7|
   There is none, O Lord, but Thee,
           |0|
    only Thee.

Chorus:
        |0|        |5|
   Evermore, evermore,
             |0|
   Walking close to Jesus
               |7|
    ever, evermore;
             |0|
   Singing when the way is clear,
                               |5|
   Praising when the path is drear,
             |0|                |7|
   Praying when temptation’s near
         |0|
    evermore.

2. Jesus came to earth for me,
   Walked the humble path for me,
   Suffered pain and agony
    on the cross;
   Rose victorious over foes,
   Sits at God’s right hand on high,
   Mediates to bring me nigh –
   Great High Priest!

3. Lord, help me to walk in love,
   Gentle, pure and like a dove,
   Humble, faithful, ever true
    in this world;
   Blameless, holy, spotless be,
   Sacrificing self for Thee,
   Separate from sinners be –
    unto Thee.

4. Then one day I’ll see Thy face,
   When on earth I’ve run my race.
   With the saints I’ll shout
    Thy praise evermore.
   Playing on the golden harps,
   Clothed in shining bridal garb,
   I shall reign with Christ,
    my Lord, evermore.
