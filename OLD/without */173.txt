1. Onward, Christian soldiers!
    |7|7             |0|
   Marching as to war,
                      |7|4-|7|
   With the cross of Jesus
    |2|7         |7|
   Going on before.

   Christ, the royal Master,
                      |5|
   Leads against the foe;

   Forward into battle,
                    |7|
   See, His banners go!

2. Like a mighty army
   Moves the church of God.
   Brothers, we are treading
   Where the saints have trod.
   We are not divided,
   All one body we;
   One in hope and doctrine,
   One in charity.

3. Crowns and thrones may perish,
   Kingdoms rise and wane;
   But the church of Jesus
   Constant will remain.
   Gates of hell can never
   ‘Gainst that church prevail;
   We have Christ’s own promise,
   Which can never fail.

4. Onward, then, ye people!
   Join our happy throng;
   Blend with ours your voices
   In the triumph song.
   Glory, laud, and honor,
   Unto Christ the King;
   This thro’ countless ages
   Men and angels sing.
