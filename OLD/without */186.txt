       |2| – |2|4     |2|
1. It matters so little how much
     |2|4      |2|
    you may own,
          |2|           |7|/|2|
   The places you’ve been and
         |4|m7            |9|7
    the people you’ve known.
            |4|m7          |9|7
   For, it all comes to nothing when
      |4|m7          |9|7
    placed at His feet;
             |4|m7        |9|7
   It means nothing to Jesus—
          |4|m7  |9|7      |2|
    just mem’ries to keep.

Chorus:
|9|m -|2| – |7|        |4|m
        Only one life—
     |6|m7         |11|7
    soon it will pass;
   |4|m           |9|7
   Only what’s done
          |2|    |9|m7    |2|7
    for Christ will last.
   |7|          |4|m      |6|m7   |11|7
   Only one chance to do His will—
       |4|m7           |9|7
   So give to Jesus all your days;
   |6|m7           |11|7
   It’s the only life that pays
        |4|m7
   When you recall
         |9|7            |2|
    you have but one life.

2. You can have all the treasures
    from faraway lands.
   You can have all the wealth you
    can hold in your hands.
   You can have all the pleasures
    that money can buy,
   But what will you have when it’s
    your turn to die?

3. The days pass so swiftly;
    the months come and go.
   The years melt away as the
    new fallen snow.
   Spring turns to summer
    and summer to fall;
   Autumn brings winter
    and death comes to all.
