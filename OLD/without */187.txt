1. My Jesus, I know
             |7|       |2|
   Thou art mine evermore.

   Though man changeth,
                  |9|
   Thou changeth not.
        |2|            |2|7
   The saints ever trust Thee
          |7|      |4|m
    and gladly adore,
         |2|           |9|7    |2|
   For Thou art Jehovah-Jireh.

Chorus:
      |2|
   O Lord, Thou art mine;
         |9|7            |2|
   Dear Lord, Thou art mine.
                                  |2|
   I’ll follow where’er Thou dost go.
                     |2|7
   The world and its cares
              |7|       |4|m
    all on Thee I resign;
         |2|                  |9|7   |2|
   Thy graces shall through me flow.

2. On Calvary’s tree
    all my sins Thou didst bear
   And carried my sicknesses too.
   I’m healed by Thy stripes;
   Now Thy mercies I share,
   For Thou art Jehovah-Rapha.

3. In life’s battles Thou girdest me
    with Thy strength;
   My enemies Thou hast subdued.
   With banner victorious
   Thou leadest me forth,
   For Thou art Jehovah-Nissi.

4. Mine eyes will I lift up
    to Thee, O my God,
   When storms and wild tempests
    do blow.
   Thy peace like a river
    is calm and so broad,
   For Thou art Jehovah-Shalom.

5. Sweet Shepherd that feedeth
    my soul every day,
   Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me.
   I rest at Thy feet
    lest I wander away,
   For Thou art Jehovah-Ra’ah.

6. Moving by faith
    into Thy righteousness,
   Thy Gospel I preach
    without shame.
   And, worship Thee, Lord,
    in Thy true holiness—
   Thou art Jehovah-Tsidkenu.

7. Thy presence is joyous
    and sweet to my soul;
   My lips shall now
    show forth Thy praise.
   To dwell with the saints
    on Mount Zion is my goal,
   For Thou art  Jehovah-Shammah.
