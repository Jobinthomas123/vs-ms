     |4|
1. There was no crown for Him
                 |4|4  |4|
    of silver or of gold.
                 |11|
   There was no diadem for Him
        |4|
    to hold.

   But blood adorned His brow
                         |4|4 |4|
    and proud its stain He bore,
                |11|7
   And sinners gave to Him
                  |4|
    the crown He wore.

Chorus:
              |9|
   A rugged cross,
                  |4|
    became His throne.
               |11|7
   His kingdom was
                |4|
    in hearts alone.
                 |9|
   He wrote His love
                |4|
    in crimson red,
                  |11|7
   And wore the thorns
              |4|
    upon His head.

2. He did not reign upon
    a throne of ivory,
   But died upon the cross
    of Calvary.
   For sinners there He counted
    all He owned but loss,
   And He surveyed His kingdom
    from a cross.

3. No purple robe He wore,
    His bleeding wounds to hide,
   But stripes upon His back
    He wore with pride.
   And from the wounds there flowed
   A crimson, cleansing stream,
   That was a cover for the
    soul unclean.
