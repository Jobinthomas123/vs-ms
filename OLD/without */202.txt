    |4|                |11|7
1. Faith will ever triumph
             |4|
    all the way;
    |9|                  |4|
   Faith will look to Jesus
            |11|7
    day by day
    |4|     |4|7       |9|
   Never fearing what the foes
        |6|m
    may say—
    |4|       |11|7           |4|
   Walking alone with Jesus.

Chorus:
   |11|7    |4|            |4|7
   I am walking with Jesus;
            |9|              |4|
   There’s nothing now to fear.
                      |1|m
   I am walking with Jesus.
            |6|            |11|7
   There’s none to me so dear.
         |4|            |4|7
   I am walking with Jesus;
       |9|            |4|
   He wipeth ev’ry tear.

   I am walking in the steps
        |11|7-|4|
    of Jesus.

2. When the storms of life
    are raging wild,
   Faith will ever grow
    in meekness mild
   Knowing that the Lord
    will keep His child—
   Walking alone with Jesus.

3. Faith will never stagger in the test,
   Casting all on Jesus, ever rest;
   Singing all the time,
    it knows the best—
   Walking alone with Jesus.

4. Left alone to fight when all
    forsake,
   Trusting in His Word
    what e’er betake,
   Faith will surely
    every barrier break—
   Walking alone with Jesus.

5. Faith alone will please
    the Lord of love;
   By it were the saints
    of God approved.
   Faith gives them a witness
    from above—
   Walking alone with Jesus.
