1. There is joy in serving Jesus
         |9|            |4|
   As I journey on my way—
             |6|
   Joy that fills the heart
            |4|
    with praises,
          |11|7      |6|m7  |11|7
   Ev’ry hour and ev’ry day.

Chorus:
             |4|
   There is joy, joy,

    joy in serving Jesus—
    |9|
   Joy that throbs
         |11|7
    within my heart.
   |4|             |11|7
   Ev’ry moment, ev’ry hour
                       |4|

    joy that never shall depart.

2. There is joy in serving Jesus,
   Joy that triumphs over pain—
   Fills my soul with heaven’s music,
   Till I join the glad refrain.

3. There is joy in serving Jesus
   As I walk alone with God.
   ‘Tis the joy of Christ my Savior,
   Who the path of suff’ring trod.

4. There is joy in serving Jesus—
   Joy amid the darkest night.
   For, I’ve learned
    the wondrous secret,
   And I’m walking in the light.
