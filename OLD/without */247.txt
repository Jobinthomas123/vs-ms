1. The first Noel the angels did say
          |5|              |0|
   Was to certain poor shepherds
    |7|   |0|          |5|   |0|
    in fields as they lay;
   |7|  |0|             |4|m
   In fields where they lay
     |5|              |0|
    keeping their sheep,
         |5|             |0|
   On a cold winter’s night
      |7|   |0|   |5|  |0|
    that was so deep.

Chorus:
    |0|      |4|m    |5|     |0| - |7|
   Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    |0|   |4|m    |5| |0|   |7|   |0|–|5|-|0|
   Born is the King of Israel.

2. And by the light of that same star
   Three wise men came from
    country afar.
   To seek for a King
    was their intent,
   And to follow the star
    wherever it went.

3. This star drew nigh
    to the northwest;
   O’er Bethlehem it took its rest.
   And, there it did both stop and
    stay,
   Right over the place
    where Jesus lay.

4. Then entered in,
    those wise men three—
   Fell rev’rently upon their knee.
   And, offered there in His presence
   Their gold and myrrh
    and frankincense.
