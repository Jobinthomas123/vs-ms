         |9|                |2|
1. Great are the ways of God
         |9|
    to know
        |4|                  |9|
   The depths of love for me;
       |9|
   By death, Thou crushed
         |2|        |9|
    the ruthless foe,
         |4|             |9|
   From sin to set me free.

Chorus:
    |9|
   Waiting for the Lord
            |2|         |11|m
    Who is coming for me,
     |9|               |6|m         |4|
   Precious are my thoughts of Thee.
    |9|
   Waiting for the Day
           |2|            |11|m
    when shadows all do flee,
         |9|         |4|      |9|
   When will that morning be?
    |9|
   Waiting for the Day,
    |2|
   Waiting for the Day,
    |4|                       |9|
   Waiting for the crowning Day;
    |9|
   Waiting for the Day,
    |2|
   Waiting for the Day,
    |9|               |4|        |9|
   Waiting for the crowning Day.

2. Thy strength divine
    doth quicken me,
   No more to falter now.
   My soul Thou calmest
    with Thy peace;
   Now at Thy feet I bow.

3. All day and night
    Thou leadest me;
   Thy tender voice I hear.
   Thy healing waters quicken me;
   No ills can make me fear.

4. What wealth of heav’n
    is stored for me—
   Joint-heir with Thee to reign.
   Eternal kingdom offered free—
   For me the Lamb was slain.
