1. For His power is great,
         |2|           |7|
   It’s supernatural power,
       |2|         |9|      |2|
   My Jesus can do anything!


Chorus:
   x2
            |7|           |4|m
   He’s the Alpha and Omega—
           |2|             |11|m7
   The beginning and the end.
       |4|m        |9|7     |2|
   My Jesus can do anything!

2. By His blood, I am saved;
   He has washed me
    white as snow.
   My Jesus can do anything!
