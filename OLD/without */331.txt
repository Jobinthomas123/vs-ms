1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
     |11|
   Thou that leadest Joseph
     |4|
    like a flock.

   Thou that dwellest
        |9|             |6|m
    between the cherubim—
      |4|      |11|     |4|
   O Lord, shine forth!

2. Stir up Thy strength, O Lord,
   And come right now;
   Come and save us!
   Turn us again—
   Cause Thy face to shine,
   And we shall be saved!
