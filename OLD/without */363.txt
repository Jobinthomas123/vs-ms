1. Oh, to be like Thee,
     |5|         |0|
    blessed Redeemer,
                  |9|m    |2|m7
   This is my constant longing
          |7|
    and prayer.
                |0|
   Gladly I’ll forfeit
    |5|               |0|
    all of earth’s treasures,
              |2|7
   Jesus, Thy perfect likeness
        |7|   — |7|7
    to wear.

Chorus:
               |5|
   Oh, to be like Thee,
   |2|m7         |5|    |0|
   Oh, to be like Thee,
              |2|m
   Blessed Redeemer,
     |7|7           |0|
    pure as Thou art.
    |0|7           |5|
   Come in Thy sweetness;
    |2|m7        |5|    |0|
   Come in Thy fullness.
                     |9|m
   Stamp Thine own image
     |2|m7    |7|   |0|
    deep on my heart.

2. Oh! to be like Thee—
    full of compassion,
   Loving, forgiving,
    tender and kind,
   Helping the helpless,
   Cheering the fainting,
   Seeking the wandering sinner
    to find.

3. Oh, to be like Thee—
    lowly in spirit,
   Holy and harmless,
    patient and brave,
   Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
   Willing to suffer, others to save.

4. Oh, to be like Thee,
   Lord, I am coming
   Now to receive
    the anointing divine.
   All that I am and have
   I am bringing;
   Lord, from this moment
    all shall be Thine.

5. Oh, to be like Thee,
    while I am pleading,
   Pour out Thy Spirit,
    fill with Thy love.
   Make me a temple
    meet for Thy dwelling,
   Fit me for life and heaven above.
