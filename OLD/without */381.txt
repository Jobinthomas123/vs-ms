   x2
    |2|m
1. Do not fear, and do not

    be dismayed
            |0|
   By reason of this great
                |2|m
    and mighty army.


Chorus:
   x3
                 |7|m
   Because the battle is

    not yours,
     |2|m
   It is the Lordâ€™s.


 |9|7        |2|m
   Do not fear.


   x2
2. Stand firm and be still,
   And see the great salvation
   The Lord your God will give you.
