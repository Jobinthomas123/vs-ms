Holy Father, Whose child I am,

Draw me closer—
               |4|
Your love to know.

Love of Jesus, melt my heart;
 |4|     |9|                |4|
Holy Spirit, fill ev’ry part.
 |4|    |9|               |4|
Holy Spirit, dwell in me,
       |9|                      |4|
Gently ruling as I yield to Thee.
