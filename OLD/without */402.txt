1. Who is like the Lord,
     |1|m/|11|    |9|
   Who’s so great,
        |11|        |4|
   So mighty in pow’r?
  |4|         |11|/|3|     |1|m   -|1|m/|11|
   Who has been our Savior,
        |9|         |11|
   Our Rock, our Fortress,

    and Tow’r?

Chorus:
 |4|        |6|/|4|      |11|
   Jesus Christ my Lord!
 |6|m        |4|           |11|
   There is no one like You!
 |4|       |6|/|4|    |11|
   You alone I adore;
        |1|m        |9|6
   I’ll love You with all
          |4|        |9|/|4|
    of my heart— forever,
        |4|             |11|7         |4|
   I’ll love You with all of my heart.

2. Was there ever any
   So kind, so tender and pure;
   Who delights in mercy,
   Whose love shall ever endure?

3. Who was born of a virgin,
   The Lamb without spot or guile—
   Son of God and of man,
   So holy and undefiled?

4. Who alone was willing
   To bear my sins and my shame?
   Was there any other
   Who’d die and suffer such pain?

5. Who has risen up from
   The grave, alive evermore,
   With a shout of triumph
   To make our victory sure?

6. Who alone is worthy
   Of all the blessing and praise?
   Who is now exalted
   On high the Ancient of Days?

7. Who will always be there
   To help when I need a friend?
   Is there one so faithful
   Whom I can trust to the end?
