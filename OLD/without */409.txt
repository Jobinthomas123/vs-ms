        |C|
When I look into
       |C|/|Bb| |F|   - |D|m7
 Your holiness,
       |C|
When I gaze into
       |C|/|Bb|  |F|  -|D|m7
 Your loveliness,
           |C|
When all things
         |C|/|Bb|
 that surround
         |F|              |D|m
Become shadows in the light
     |G|4 -|G|
 of You;

When I’ve found the joy
 of reaching Your heart,
When my will becomes
 enthroned in Your love;
When all things that surround
Become shadows in the light
 of You;

           |F| - |G|
I worship You.
           |E|m7 – |A|m7
I worship You;
     |D|m7         -|G|
The reason I live
                |C|  –|C|7
 is to worship You.
           |F| – |G|
I worship You.
           |E|m7 – |A|m7
I worship You;
     |D|m7         -|G|
The reason I live
                |C|
 is to worship You.
