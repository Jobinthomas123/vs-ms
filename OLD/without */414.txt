I will praise You,
       |A|        |E|
 O my Lord and God,
      |A|            |E|
For when I was a sinner
          |A|         |E|
 You had mercy and saved me!
         |E|
I will praise You,
       |A|        |E|
 O my Lord and God
   |A|                |E|
Because You have cleansed me
            |A|    |E|
 with Your holy Word!
        |F#|
I will praise You,
       |B|        |F#|
 O my Lord and God
        |B|            |F#|
â€˜Cause You have now filled me
             |B|         |F#|
 with Your sweet Holy Spirit!
         |E|
I will praise You,
       |A|        |E|
 O my Lord and God,
     |A|         |E|
For You are preparing me
     |B|7              |E|
 to reign with Your Son.

               |B|7
Lord, in this world
              |E|
 I can desire nothing,
              |B|7
For there is nothing to me
         |E|
 it can give;
           |B|7
My main desire is to live
       |E|
 with You, Lord,
               |F#|
And there to praise Your name
          |B|7
 eternally.

         |E|
I will praise You,
       |A|        |E|
 O my Lord and God,
    |A|            |E|
For making me a vessel
                |B|7         |E|
 through which Jesus can shine!
