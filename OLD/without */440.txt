Chorus:
|G|      |C|       |G|—|C|               |G|
   It won’t be long ‘til we see Jesus;
               |A|m – |D|7
   It won’t be long
                        |G|
    ‘til we’ll be with Him!
       |C|       |G|—|C|                |G|
   It won’t be long  ‘til we see Jesus;
               |A|m – |D|7
   It won’t be long
                            |G|
    ‘til we see Him face to face!

    |A|m                  |D|7
1. Yes, there are many mansions
           |C|                      |G|
    in My Father’s house, it’s true,
       |A|m             |D|7
   But I will now prepare
               |G|            |G|7
    a place especially for you.
   |C|             |A|
   If you, as a faithful bride,
          |G|                 |E|7
    will watch and wait for Me,
           |A|m                |D|7
   I’ll return to catch you away
                 |C|
   That where I am,
                   |G|
    there you may be.

2. All of creation’s groaning,
    for it’s longing to be free;
   And all of heaven’s waiting
    for that glorious liberty.
   Lift your eyes and lift your head;
    it is so plain to see
   That salvation’s closer today
   Compared to when you first
    believed.

3. Yes, there are many trials,
   But My grace will see you
    through
   If you will fully trust that
    what I promised I will do.
   Don’t let Satan take away
    your faith so dear to Me;
   Overcome him that you may
   Reign upon My throne eternally.
