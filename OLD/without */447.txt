      |D|              |A|/|C#|
1. I make my life a prayer to You;
      |B|m
   I want to do what
         |B|m/|A|
    You want me to—
       |G|
   No empty words and
     |A|
    no white lies,
       |G|
   No token prayers,
        |A|
    no compromise.
      |D|              |A|/|C#|
   I wanna shine the light You gave
      |B|m
   Through Your Son
         |B|m/|A|
    You sent to save us
     |G|                |A|
   From ourselves and our despair;
       |G|               |A|
   It comforts me to know
                    |D|
    You’re really there.

Chorus:
      |D|                |A|/|C#|
   I wanna thank You, Lord,
               |B|m          |B|m/|A|
    for being patient with me.
       |G|                |D|/|F#|
   Oh, it’s so hard to see
             |E|m7        |A|
    when my eyes are on me!
      |D|                  |A|/|C#|
   I guess I’ll have to trust
                |B|m             |B|m/|A|
   And just believe what You say;
               |G|       |D|/|F#|
   Oh, You’re coming again,
               |E|m7      |A|
    coming to take me away!

2. I wanna die and let You give
   Your life to me so that
    I might live,
   And share the hope You
    gave to me—
   The love of Christ that set me free.
   I wanna tell the world out there
   You’re not some fable or fairy tale
   That I made up inside my head.
   You’re God the Son;
   You’re risen from the dead.
