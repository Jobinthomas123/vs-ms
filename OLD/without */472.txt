1. He is fairer than the lily
            |D|    –|D|4
    of the valley;
          |G|
   He is brighter than
         |A|        |D|
    the morning star.
          |G|
   He is purer than
          |A|
    the snow,
  |D|                   |B|m
   Fresher than the breeze,
    |E|m          |A|
   Lovelier by far than
             |D|
    all of these.

   And conquers the raging seas;
 |C|/|D|                   |G|/|D|
   He is the High and Lofty One
          |D|          |G|/|D|-|D|
   Who inhabits eternity,
  |G|       |A|       |D|
   Creator of the universe,
              |F#|               |B|m
   And He’s clothed with majesty;
 |E|m           |G|              |A|
   He is and evermore shall be.
