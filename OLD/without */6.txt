I will sing of the mercies

  of the Lord forever,
        |7|            |0|
I will sing, I will sing.

I will sing of the mercies

  of the Lord forever;
        |7|
I will sing of the mercies

  of the Lord.

With my mouth
                |0|
  will I make known
     |7|                 |0|
Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness.
         |5|
With my mouth
                |0|
  will I make known
     |2|7                      |7|
Thy faithfulness to all generations.
