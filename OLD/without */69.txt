1. Father, heavenly Father,
                |6|m
   Who hath bestowed such love
       |11|7
     upon us.
       |4|
   His only Son,
                |1|m
     sent He to Calvary,
                    |6|m     -|11|7
   That we might through Him
                  |4|
     be His sons too.

2. Jesus, name above all names,
   Beautiful Savior, glorious Lord,
   Emmanuel, God is with us,
   Blessed Redeemer, living Word.

3. Spirit, Holy Spirit,
   As our Helper, guides us in truth.
   Comforter, living inside us,
   Perfecting the work that
    our Father began.
