       D                                 A              Bm
    We fall down; we lay our crowns
                      G           A
        at the feet of Jesus.
                   D                    A                  Bm
    The greatness of mercy and love—
                      G           A
        at the feet of Jesus.

Chorus:
                                    G      D/F#   Em
    And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy.”
                                    G      D/F#   Em
    And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy.”
                                    G      D/F#   Em
    And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy
       A             D
        is the Lamb.”
