                         E
1. You are merciful
                    A/E         E
        to the lowest one;
                         E                B/E          E
    You are wonderful and so kind.
                          E
    You are beautiful;
                      A/E            E
        no one else compares.
                           E
    You’re majestic, Lord,
                      B/E           E
        and the reason why...

Chorus:
                                               B
    The reason why we sing
                                  E/G# - A
        and give You our hearts,
                                           B
    The reason why we worship
                    C#m
        Your name,
             E/G#                         B
    The reason why our lips
                                         C#m
        are singing Your praises—
                             F#m
    You are the reason;
                             B
    You’re the reason.

2.    You are holy, Lord, and so wise,
    The Creator of everything.
    You have power, Lord,
        no one else can share.
    You’re the only God,
        and the reason why...

3.    We are grateful, Lord,
        for all You’ve done,
    And the favor You
        have shown to us.
    Your love, oh Lord,
        no one can contend;
    You’re my Savior, Friend,
        and the reason why...

Ending:
                               E
        ... for our praise.
