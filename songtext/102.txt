                        E                               B7
    When I think of the goodness
               E
        of Jesus,

    When I think of what
                     C#m         F#m—B
        He’s done for me,
                          E                E7
    Then my soul cries out,
                     A — F#m
        “Hallelujah!
                     E            B7           E
    Praise God for saving me.”
