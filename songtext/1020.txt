Chorus:
                               G                              D
    We will not fall; we will not fail.
                        A                              D
    By the blood we will prevail;
                                G                         D/F#
    Through the power of His name
                      E/G#              A2
    We will never be ashamed.
                           G                               D
    Until the Lord does call us home,
                               F#
    Until we’re there
                                  Bm7
        to share His throne,
                                    G
    We won’t give up;
                                    D/F#
        we won’t give in—
                                 Em              A            D
    The Lord has called us for the win.

               G                 D
1. For many generations,
                       A                                       Bm
        God’s truth’s been marching on,
             G                           D/F#
    As many faithful Christians
                           E                                  A
         ran their race, passed the baton.
                     G                    F#
    Though evil rises, darkness grows,
                  Bm
    They wouldn’t waver,
        Esus4               E7
        wouldn’t let go—
    Em7                          D/F#
    Now the torch is passed to us,
               A                 Dsus4-D
        to carry it on home.

2.    O Lord, please light a fire
        that Satan can’t put out—
    Flames of love and holiness,
        that cast out fear and doubt.
    Let worldliness lose its hold;
        let purity and humility grow.
    Souls who’d rather die
        than give in—
    You’ve called us for the win.

3.    Oh, rise from every nation,
        you mighty of the land,
    Made strong out of weakness,
        in obeying His command.
    Satan trembles, darkness flees,
    When these soldiers
        get on their knees.
    The Lord Himself
        will lead us forth—
    Come on and take a stand!

4. The trump of God will sound,
        the saints will all arise,
    The valiant ones from earliest days
        go soaring through the skies!
    King of kings and Lord of lords
        will tell us then,
    “There’s still more:
    In seven years, I’ll ride again;
    You’ll follow Me for the win.”
