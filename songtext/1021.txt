Chorus:
        C
    God of all grace,
                              F                  C
        You have saved my soul;
                                                     F
    Humbly I go to Your throne,
      G   Am
        O Lord.
                      F
    It’s by grace I am saved
                           G
        through faith;
                       F
    It is the gift of God.
                       C
    It is the gift of God.

         Am
1. Washed by the blood
                              G      Am
        of the spotless Lamb,
          C                                                 G  C
    Washed from the sinful man I am,
         F                                            C
    That I should be to the praise
                                        G
        of the glory of grace.

2.    Word was made flesh
        full of grace and truth,
    Light came and shined
        on me and you,
    Christ came to seek
        and to save fallen man’s race.

3.    Walking by faith,
        trusting in His grace,
    Growing in Christ
        as I seek His face,
    Working in me is the power of God setting me free.

4.    Spirit of grace,
        come sweep over me,
    Sanctify, cleanse me thoroughly—
    Others to see only Christ
        Who is living in me.
