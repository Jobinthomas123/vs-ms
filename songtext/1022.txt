Chorus:
                          G                  D
    Bless the Lord, O my soul;
    A/C#     Bm
    O my soul,
       G                   D        Asus4-A
    Worship His holy name.
                         G             Bm
    Sing like never before,
    G   A     Bm
    O my soul.
             G                       A      D
    I'll worship Your holy name.

               G                  D
1.    The sun comes up;
                 A               Bm
    It’s a new day dawning.
G-                         D                   A         Bm
    It’s time to sing Your song again.
              G                    D
    Whatever may pass,
                     A/C#                  Bm
    And whatever lies before me–
G-                        D
    Let me be singing
                        Asus4-A     D
    When the evening comes.

2.    You’re rich in love,
    And You’re slow to anger.
    Your name is great,
    And Your heart is kind.
    For all Your goodness
    I will keep on singing–
    Ten thousand reasons
    For my heart to find.

3.    And on that day
    When my strength is failing,
    The end draws near
    And my time has come,
    Still my soul
    Will sing Your praise unending–
    Ten thousand years
    And then forevermore.
