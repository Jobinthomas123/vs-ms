               C                     F
1.    In shady green pastures,
           Em                  Am7
    So rich and so sweet,
               Dm                          G              C
    God leads His dear children along.
        F/G               C                   Dm
    Where the waters cool flow
                             Em                 Am7
    Bathes the weary one’s feet
               Dm                          G              C
    God leads His dear children along.

Chorus:
                                           C/E
    Some through the waters,
       F                                  C
    Some through the flood,
                                        Am7
    Some through the fire,
             D7                            G7
    But all through the blood.
       C                                    C/E
    Some through great sorrow,
                 F                     C
    But God gives a song
                               Am7
    In the night season
              Dm         G     C
    And all the day long.

2.    Sometimes on the mount
    Where the sun shines so bright,
    God leads His dear children along.
    Sometimes in the valley
    In darkest of night,
    God leads His dear children along.

3.    Though sorrows befall us
    And Satan oppose,
    God leads His dear children along.
    Through grace we can conquer,
    Defeat all our foes–
    God leads His dear children along.

4.    Away from the mire
    And away from the clay,
    God leads His dear children along.
    Away up in glory
    Eternity’s day
    God leads His dear children along.
