       E                                F#m—B7
    How great is our God;
                                          E—C#m
    How great is His name.
                                        F#m—B7
    How great is His love—
                              E
    Forever the same!
                                             E — E7
    He rolled back the waters
                                               A—F#m
        of the mighty Red Sea,

    And He said “I’ll never
         E               —B7
        leave you;
                                         E
    Put your trust in Me.”
