1.    My God,
                  F                          C/E
    As I wait upon Your will,
                     F                         C
    You've told me to be still
                F                                 Gsus4-G
    And hold on with expectation.
              Am
    My Lord,
                    F                      C/E
    Your Word is my strength;
           F                                  C
    It lifts me when I'm faint
                    F                         Gsus4-G
    In the depths of tribulation.

Chorus:
                       F                      C
    As You hold up the heavens,
                    G - E/G# - Am
    You're holding me
                         F
    By Your right hand
              C                  Gsus4-G
        of power and might.
                 F                         C
    As I look to Your presence
                  G      E/G#    Am
    I will sing Your praise;
                                F
    And through all
                         G         Csus4-C
    You will be my Light.

2.    My Love,
    As I wait, I will serve You;
    I'll do all You want me to
    With a fire and a passion.
    My Light,
    Please show Your love
        through me,
    So that all the world may see
    Your grace and Your salvation.
