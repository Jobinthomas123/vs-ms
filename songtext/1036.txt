                         G
1.    Let our praise arise
                           Em
        from this temple;
               Am             D        G
    Let it fill this holy place.
                                             Em
    Let the people come in declaring;
                 C            D         G
    Our God forever reigns!

Chorus:
         G                 C               D        G
    This is our God; He ever reigns!
               G              C
    The Lion of Judah
                       D                    Em
        shall break every chain.
         G                  C
    This is our God.
    G/B                   C
    This is our God.
    G/B                   C             D         G
    This is our God; He ever reigns!

2.    Let us raise up high His banner–
    A glorious truth for all to see.
    And we will declare this anthem:
    Our God forever reigns!

3.    Oh, I hear a sound of victr’y
    Rising from the church today.
    And we know our King is coming;
    Our God forever reigns!

Bridge:
                         G             C
    He’s the King of kings
                         D          Em
    And the Lord of lords.
                       G/B         C
    He’s the mighty One,
                       D               G
    The unchanging God.
