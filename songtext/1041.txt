                               A                   F#m
1.    There is a throne up in heaven,
                       D                                    A
    And by faith I’ll be seated there;
                                       D
    It’s a hope set before me,
                      Bm                                  E
    And no power can take it away.

Chorus:
                     A                        F#m
    So I’ll fight the good fight,
                           D
    Keep the faith and
                          E
    Keep on running.
                           A             F#m
    There’s a prize up ahead,
                          D                      E
    One that won’t fade away.
              F#m                             D
    I am weak but He is strong;
        A/C#                       B7
    I know what I believe–
                       D/F#                              E/G#
    That I’m more than a conqueror;
                                      A
    I’m strong in Christ.

2.    Hearing His voice is my refuge;
    I’m no longer afraid to die.
    It’s His word that sustains me,
    And I’m full of His power
        and grace.

3.    God has a plan just for my life,
    And He’s making me more
        like Christ.
    Ever drawing me near Him;
    Now I’m justified and glorified.

4.    Jesus the King up in heaven,
    He has for me a glorious crown.
    Through the trials I will make it,
    For His Spirit is burning inside.
