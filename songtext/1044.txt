                  D       G/A       D            Bm
1. There is a name I love to hear;
       Em           A              D  - G/A
    I love to sing its worth.
             D                F#7/C#-Bm       Am
    It sounds like music in my ear–
       D     G- D/F# Em   G/A            D
    The swe–e–test name on earth.

Chorus:
     D    G/A                  D-Bm
    Oh, how I love Jesus.
   E7-A                              D - G/A
       Oh, how I love Jesus.
     D    F#7                 Bm
    Oh, how I love Jesus
         Em-D/F#-G   E7     A7       D
    Because   He first loved me.

2.    It tells me of a Savior's love
    Who died to set me free.
    It tells me of His precious blood–
    The sinner's perfect plea.

3.    It tells of One
    Whose loving heart
    Can feel my deepest woe,
    Who in my sorrow bears a part
    That none can bear below.

4.    It bids my trembling heart rejoice
    And dries each rising tear;
    It tells me in a still small voice
    To trust and never fear.

5.    Jesus, the name I love so well,
    The name I love to hear.
    No saint on earth
    Its worth can tell;
    No heart conceive how dear.

6.    And there with all the
    Blood-bought throng,
    From sin and sorrow free,
    I’ll sing the new eternal song
    Of Jesus’ love to me.
