2.    I am strengthened
    ‘Neath Your mighty wings;
    Here I’ll wait
    For the healing they bring.
    And Your voice calms my fears
    While I wait here;
    I’ll trust Your Word, Lord,
    As I’m waiting here.

3.    With my faith, Lord,
    I reach out to You;
    Jesus, You’re faithful,
    And You’ll see me through.
    Just one touch from Your hand
    Is all I need;
    Oh touch me right now, Lord;
    It’s all that I need.

4.    Yahweh Rapha,
    I look unto You;
    There is no other
    That heals like You do.
    And this body is Yours,
    To do Your will;
    Strengthen me, Lord,
    And I’ll do all Your will.
