                    D                         A
1.    I will sing of my Redeemer
                          Em             A            D
    And His wondrous love to me;
                      Bm     Em             A
    On the cruel cross He suffered
                          Em          A             D
    From the curse to set me free.

Chorus:
    D/F#            G                          D
    Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer;
                           A
    With His blood
                                  D
    He purchased me.
                       G
    On the cross
                                   D
    He sealed my pardon,
                        A                                   D
    Paid the debt and made me free.

2.    I will tell the wondrous story
    How my lost estate to save;
    In His boundless love and mercy,
    He the ransom freely gave.

3.    I will praise my dear Redeemer;
    His triumphant power I’ll tell.
    How the victory He giveth
    Over sin and death and hell.

4.    I will sing of my Redeemer
    And His heav’nly love to me;
    He from death to life
    Hath brought me,
    Son of God with Him to be.
