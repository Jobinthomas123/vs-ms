       C#m
1.    Breaches repaired,
       A
    Paths are restored,
                           E
    No more carrying
                                G#m
    My hurts anymore.
         C#m
    I bring them to Calv'ry
           -A
    And there Your love,
         E/G#  A     B
    It sets me free.

Chorus:
                        A         E
    Lord, I praise You
             C#m                 B
    For healing my hurts.
                       A         E
    Lord, I thank You;
                 C#m                          -B
    You know all I’ve been through,
               A                     E                 B
    Acquainted with all that I feel–
      C#m          B           A
    Bless'd scarred hands
             A/B             Esus4-E
    Are waiting to heal.

2.    My secret wounds
    No longer hide;
    I’ve run to Your
    Arms open wide.
    You took all my grief
    My sorrow bore;
    I let it go.

3.    Now I am free,
    Chains of hurt gone;
    My joyful heart
    Bursts with a song.
    Always with me,
    My Emmanuel,
    In me You dwell.

Bridge:
                                 B
    You saw my pain,
                                  C#m
    You heard my cry,
              F#m-E    A
    To deli–ver me
              A/C#             B
    You came and died.
                     A                                  B
    As I believe, Your power heals;
                   F#m                                B
    As I believe, Your power heals.
