       G                  A            G/B         A/C#
1.    Jesus, You are the fount of life–
           G                    D                          A
    A source that never can run dry;
                 D                           Bm
    The more I drink of You I find
                 G             A
    The more I desire.

Chorus:
     G                D
    Fill me again,
                             Bm
    Touch me again,
      G                                A
    Hold me in Your arms.
                               D
    I need Your love,
                               Bm
    I need Your touch,
                     G
    Let me be the one
                                         A
    To capture Your heart;
                        D
    Fill me again.

2.    There in the heav’ns
    And here below,
    I find no love
    That’s like Your own.
    My longing is for You alone,
    More of You to know.

3.    All my delight is in You, Lord,
    You’re my treasure, my reward.
    The feast of love I’m waiting for
    With You evermore.

4.    Soon in the clouds
    You will appear;
    Your coming, Lord, is very near.
     I’ll look into Your face so dear;
    Your voice of love I’ll hear.
