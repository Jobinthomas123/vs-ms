     Am
1.    Many years have passed
             Dm
    Since I began this race,
          Am
    But it has not been easy
    Dm           E7
    On my own.
             Am
    Oh what would I have done
               Dm
    Without His saving grace?
     F9                               E7
    All the praise to Him!

Chorus:
             Am
    Oh, Jesus!
                                          Dm7
    I want to live for Jesus,
                                         Fmaj7
    I want to stand for Jesus,
         Em                   Am
    I want to overcome!

2.    Many, many times
    I’ve failed to do my part.
    How many, many times
    I’ve compromised.
    So many, many times
    I grieved God’s broken heart;
    I desire to change.

3.    When temptation comes,
    I know I cannot stand.
    My confidence has gone;
    I know I’ll fail,
    But when the Lord upholds me
    By His strength I’ll stand.
    Glory to His name!

4.    He is known as Alpha,
    God Who heals my past.
    And He’s the One Who
    Leads me day by day.
    And He is Omega,
    He’ll lead me to the last;
    He’s the great I Am!

5.    The battle rages on
    Against His chosen ones;
    The army of the Lord
    Must stand and fight.
    The weakest will be strong,
    The enemy will run;
    Rise and let us go!
