        C
    I can’t stop singing,

    And I can’t stop shouting
                                                     G
    Since the power fell on me.

    I can’t stop singing,

    And I can’t stop shouting;
                                 C
    Jesus set me free.

    The Spirit came

    With tongues of fire
                            C7       F
    And rested upon me;
         Dm
    I can’t stop singing,
                  Em                Am
    And I can’t stop shouting
                        Dm         G            C
    Since the power fell on me.
