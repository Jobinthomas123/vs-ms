1.    Holy Lamb of God,
                                   A/C#-D
    You were slain for me;
                            Em
    Though the sins were mine,
                  D/F#              A
    It was You Who died.
      D/F#           G    A/C#-D
    And I’ll ne’er forget
                            G               D/F#
    The great price You paid
            Bm           A          D
    To take my sins away.

Chorus:
      A      A/C#              G               D
    Holy, precious Lamb of God,
        A         G/A        D                A
    Worthy of the highest praise,
                         D
    And the blessing,
             A/C#               Bm-Em
    The honor, the glory–
     D/F#          A                D
    Worthy Lamb of God.

2.    Precious Lamb of God,
    You bore all my griefs–
    Every tear I’ve cried,
    All the hurt inside.
    And in tenderness
    You have healed each wound;
    You’ve done what none could do.

3.    Blessed Lamb of God,
    By Your stripes I’m healed
    Of my sicknesses;
    This Your promise is.
    Be it life or death,
    I will trust You, Lord;
    O Lamb of God, I’m Yours.
