C-                   G
1.    Blessed be Your name
                 Am7                   F
    In the land that is plentiful,
                                   C
    Where Your streams
                  G
        of abundance flow,
               F
    Blessed be Your name.
C-                   G
    Blessed be Your name
                           Am7
    When I'm found in the
                          F
        desert place,
                           C
    Though I walk through
                  G
        the wilderness,
               F
    Blessed be Your name.

Pre-Chorus:
C-                                  G
    Ev’ry blessing You
                                 -Am7
        pour out, I’ll
                                     F
    Turn back to praise.
C-                                           G
    When the darkness closes
                        -Am7
        in, Lord
                            F
    Still I will say,

Chorus:
                                     C                      G
    Blessed be the name of the Lord;
                                        Am7-F
    Blessed be Your name.
                                     C                       G
    Blessed be the name of the Lord;
                                       Am7-G       F
    Blessed be Your glorious name.

2.    Blessed be Your name
    When the sun's shining
        down on me,
    When the world's all
        as it should be,
    Blessed be Your name.
    Blessed be Your name
    On the road marked with
        suffering,
    Though there's pain in the offering,
    Blessed be Your name.

Bridge:
                C                            G
    You give and take away,
               Am7                         F
    You give and take away,
                 C                                   G
    My heart will choose to say,
                 Am7                           F
    Lord, blessed be Your name!
