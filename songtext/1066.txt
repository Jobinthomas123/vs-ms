           F                                  Bb
1.    When dark shadows fall

        around me,
           F            F/A             C7        F
    When the day turns into night
               F/A           Bb          Gm
    I am safe within His keeping
     F/C            Dm          Gm  C    F
    For He draws me to His side.

Chorus:
      F               F/A      Bb               Gm
    Ever faithful through the fury,
       F/C                 Dm
    Through the fire and
           G7                  C7
        through the flood
     F              F/A    Bb        Gm
    I am trusting as He guides me
     F/C     Dm               Gm      C7   F
    Ever faithful through His love.

2.    Looking back, I see more clearly
    And my heart will not forget
    All the ways His grace
        has kept me.
    He has never failed me yet.

Bridge:
       F                 Bb/F
    Savior, Redeemer,
       G7                            Eb – C/E
    Comforter and Friend
         F              Bb/F
    Healer, Provider,
       G7                           Eb – C/E
    Time and time again
