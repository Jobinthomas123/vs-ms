          C/E              F        G           C
1.    When my heart is overwhelmed
                          F             G            Am
        by the pressures of this world,
                      C/E          F             G
    When I feel that I have lost
                   C                      F
        my way, and my vision
        C/E                G
        has been blurred,

Pre-chorus:
                       Am             F
    Bring me to my knees,
                                C     G/B
        where I’ll find You;
                Am              F                   C - G
    Take me to a place of surrender.

Chorus:
                     Am
    At the cross,
               F               C               G
        I find such perfect peace.
                      Am
    At the cross,
                        F                    C          G
        Your blood pours out to me.
                                  C   C/E   F
    Lord, please take my life
         G/E     F        G     Am            F
        and make me whole in You,
                 G
        in You.
                      Am
    At the cross,
                      F              C                 G
        Your power strengthens me
                     Am
    At the cross,
                       F         C            G
        Your mercy covers me.
                   C -  C/E - F
    I will have no fear
         G/E        F     G    Am
        when You are near;
                F          G                            C
    So, Lord, keep me at the cross.

2.    Lord, I know that
        You’re my guide;
    You will lead my every step.
    Faithful are Your words to me,
        and You’ve never left my side.
