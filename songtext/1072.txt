                     D            Bm                      Asus4
1.    Great God and Savior of mankind,
          A                             D
    I give myself to Thee;
                            Bm                              Asus4
    There is no one that loves me so—
          Em            A           D – D7
    A faithful God to me.
                G              Em                            D
    My Friend in times of trouble sore,
           A              A7              D
    A constant loving Guide;
      A      D/F#     Bm                Asus4
    Thy name alone will I adore
               Em             A           D
    And e’er in Thee confide.

2.    O Holy One from heav’n above,
    My life belongs to Thee.
    Whom else on earth could I desire?
    To Thee I’ll faithful be.
    My refuge from the swelling tide,
    A shelter from the storm,
    In Thee alone my soul can hide;
    I want to know Thee more.

3.    Thou callest me to follow Thee,
    So joyfully I’ll go;
    Where’er the hand of God
        may lead
    I shall not be alone.
    My Bridegroom
        and my coming King,
    My soul doth wait for Thee.
    My longing is for Thee alone—
    Thy glorious face to see.

4.    And soon the trumpet will resound
    Thy glory fill the sky;
    Then in the clouds
    I’ll meet my Lord
    Transported, I shall rise—
    To see my Savior face to face
    And e’er with Him abide,
    Fulfillment of His wondrous grace
    My longing satisfied.
