F–   C/E Dm
You laid aside your majesty,
  F/ABb
Gave up everything for me,
 F/A
Suffered at the hands
  Gm  Csus4 – C
Of those You had created.
F–   C/E Dm
You took all my guilt and shame
F/ABb
When You died and rose again;
F/A
Now today You reign—
 Gm  Csus4 – C
In heaven and earth exalted.

F– C/E
I really want to worship
  Dm
You, my Lord;
 F/A
You have won my heart
  Bb
 and I am Yours.
  F/A
Forever and ever
Gm– Csus4 – C
I will love You.
F–   C/E
You are the only One Who
  Dm
died for me,
F/A   Bb
Gave Your life to set me free,
  F/A   Gm
So I lift my voice to You in
 Csus4 – C  F
adora   —tion.
