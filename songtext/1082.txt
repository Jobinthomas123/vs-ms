         F                       Bb
1.    Since I started for the Kingdom,
       F              G7                    C â€“ C7
    Since my life He controls,
       F            F7              Bb           Dm
    Since I gave my heart to Jesus,
              F/C
    The longer I serve Him
                  C7                  F
    The sweeter He grows.

Chorus:
               C               C7
    The longer I serve Him
                   F
    The sweeter He grows;
                 C                  C7
    The more that I love Him
                  F
    More love He bestows.
                                         F7
    Each day is like heaven;
               Bb               Dm
    My heart overflows,
               F/C
    The longer I serve Him
                   C7                  F
    The sweeter He grows.

2.    Every need He is supplying;
    Plenteous grace He bestows.
    Every day my way gets brighter;
    The longer I serve Him
    The sweeter He grows.
