1.    Lord, before Your throne
                          Fm6
    I bend my knees;
        C
    I lay all that I have
                                 Dm/B – E7
        here at Your feet.
                   Am                     Gm
    Even though I’m undeserving
              F                          C/E
    Of who You are to me,
                      D/F#
    You’ve called my name
                                        F/G
        to be Your very own.

Chorus:
    F/A –   G/B       Fm/C     C
    I’m     un  –  wor  – thy of
        Am                  Dm            G
        all You’ve done for me;
                             Fm/C  –   C
    Lord, Your   mer  – cy
                C/E           F      C/E
        has set my spirit free.
                 F                                      G
    Your love has made me whole,
                              C                  E7     Am
    And Your wings they carry me
                                  D    – F/G
    When I feel weak.
              Fm/C – C
    I am humbled
        Am            Dm             G7
        by Your constant pow’r;
                                  Fm/C – C
    You’re always near   me
        C/E         F            C/E
        in my darkest hour.
                      F                              G
    When I call upon Your name,
                  C              E7                 Am
    You flood me with Your grace.
                  D/F#
    I’m unworthy,
                                G–E7    Am
        yet You’ve chosen me;
                     Dm
    I’m unworthy,
                                  Fm/G   C
        yet You’ve chosen me.

2.    Even when life’s hard
    I’ll praise Your name.
    Because You’ve shown me
        time and time again—
    You are faithful through the ages;
    I’ll hold Your promises.
    My heart can rest in You,
        my great I Am.
