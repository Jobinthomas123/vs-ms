1.    Father, we are waiting here
             A -
        for  You;
         Bm
    Come and overwhelm us
                              Em
        with Your love.
               D
    Surround us with Your glory

        now we pray;

    Draw us nearer to
                                  Em
        Your secret place.

Chorus:
                          G              A
    May we abide in You,
       Bm
    Keep our hearts from
                                   G
        wandering away.

    May we remain
                                          A
        hidden in Your grace,
            Bm
    Forever in Your perfect
                           G
        peace to stay.

2.    Jesus, come and cleanse
        our lives today;
    Purify us, Lord,
        now with Your fire.
    O holy God, break our hearts
        for our sins,
    Mold us to Your good
        and perfect will.

Bridge:
      Bm
    Holy Spirit speak,
         A
    Call unto the deep,
        Bm                     F#m
    Drawing us to You, Lord;
       G
    Father, hear our plea
        A
    For our greatest need
    Em                       A
    Is that we be holy.
