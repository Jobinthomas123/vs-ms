                A                                   A7
1.    I’ve seen the lightning flashing,
                  D                               A
    And heard the thunder roll,
              E7
    I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing,
                                                   A
    Trying to conquer my soul.
                                                            A7
    I’ve heard the voice of my Savior,
       D                                          A
    Telling me still to fight on,
            E7
    He promised never to leave me,
                                              A
    Never to leave me alone.

Chorus:
      A                   A7
    No, never alone,
      D                    A
    No, never alone;
             E7
    He promised never to leave me,
                                             A
    Never to leave me alone.
                             A7
    No, never alone,
      D                    A
    No, never alone;
             E7
    He promised never to leave me,
                                              A
    Never to leave me alone.

2.    The world’s fierce winds
        are blowing
    Temptations sharp and keen;
    I have a peace in knowing
    My Savior stands between.
    He stands to shield me
        from danger
    When earthly friends are all gone;
    He promised never to leave me,
    Never to leave me alone.

3.    When in affliction’s valley
    I’m treading the road of care,
    My Savior helps me to carry
    My cross when heavy to bear.
    My feet, entangled with briars,
    Ready to cast me down;
    My Savior whispers His promise,
    “I never will leave thee alone.”

4.    He died on Calv’ry’s mountain
    For me they pierced His side,
    For me He opened the fountain,
    The crimson, cleansing tide;
    For me He’s waiting in glory,
    Seated upon His throne,
    He promised never to leave me,
    Never to leave me alone.
