             D
	I am free, free, free,
	                                             A
	The Lord has set me free.

	I have met a Man,
	                                   D
	A Man from Galilee.

	He took away my sins,
	          D7                       G
	My heavy load of sin;
	                                   D
	And now I am rejoicing,
	                        A      D
	I am free, free, free.
