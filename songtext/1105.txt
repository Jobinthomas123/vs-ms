Chorus:
       D                             A/C#
    Till the break of day
    D                                F#m
    I will watch and wait;
    A/C#        D           E           F#m
    I will wait till Jesus comes.
       D                           Esus4 - E
    Till the break of day,
                     D                      F#m
    When shadows flee away,
    D             E              A
    I will keep my garments white
        E                         C#m
    Walking in the light.
       D                             Esus4 - E
    Till the break of day,
                  Bm       A/C#
    When Jesus comes to
          D               E           A
        take His bride away.

         A                             E
1.    Darkness is all around,
             F#m                                      C#m
    But light grows within my soul.
       D                       A/C#
    Jesus shines brighter
     D              A/C#
    In every trial;
     Bm                E                 A
    He is my hope and goal.

2.    I'm just a pilgrim here;
    This world is not my home.
    All its attractions,
    They're just distractions;
    I'm headed for the throne.

3.    Weeping may last the night,
    But our joy comes in the morn.
    The trumpet will sound, and
    We'll hear His voice shout,
    Then rise to meet our Lord.
