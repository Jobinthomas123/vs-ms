2.By faith our fathers roamed
the earth
With the pow'r of His promise in their hearts—
Of a holy city built
by God's own hand,
A place where peace
and justice reign.

3.By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for
Messiah would appear,
With the pow'r to break
the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from
the grave.

4.By faith the church was called
to go
In the pow'r of the Spirit
to the lost,
To deliver captives and
to preach good news
In ev'ry corner of the earth.

5.By faith the mountain shall
be moved,
And the pow'r of the gospel
shall prevail;
For we know in Christ
all things are possible
For all who call upon His name.
