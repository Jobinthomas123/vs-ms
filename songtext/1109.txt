Just one word from heaven
           B7                                   E
And sinners are made whole;
                                        C#m7
Just one word from heaven
            F#7                             B7
And freedom takes control.
                  C#m       G#7/C
From the lips of Jesus,
               E/B           F#m7
Mercy calls my name.
                   E/B           C#m7-F#7
Just one word from heaven,
                     A/B      B7          E
And weâ€™ll never be the same.
