1.    Come behold the
                           Dsus2/G
        wondrous myst'ry
                     D                        Asus4
    In the dawning of the King;
                     Bm7                          Dsus2/G
    He the theme of heaven's praises
                              G       Asus4-D
    Robed in frail humanity.
    D/F#        G                         D/F#
    In our longing, in our darkness
                        Bm        Bm/A             G
    Now the light of  life  has come;
                          D
    Look to Christ Who
                 Gsus2/B
        condescended,
                          G         Asus4       D
    Took on flesh to ransom us.

2.    Come behold the
        wondrous myst'ry—
    He the perfect Son of man;
    In His living, in His suff'ring
    Never trace nor stain of sin.
    See the true and better Adam,
    Come to save the hell-bound man;
    Christ, the great and
        sure fulfillment
    Of the law, in Him we stand.

3.    Come behold the
        wondrous myst'ry—
    Christ the Lord upon the tree;
    In the stead of ruined sinners,
    Hangs the Lamb in victory.
    See the price of our redemption;
    See the Father's plan unfold—
    Bringing many sons to glory,
    Grace unmeasured, love untold.

4.    Come behold the
        wondrous myst'ry—
    Slain by death the God of life,
    But no grave could
        e'er restrain Him;
    Praise the Lord, He is alive!
    What a foretaste of deliv'rance,
    How unwavering our hope;
    Christ in power resurrected,
    As we will be when He comes.
