    D                      G/D
1.    I am here before You,
                                D
        Lord, with nothing;
      G                    D/F#                  Em - A
    All of me is open now to You.
         D                             A/C#
    Come and fill my heart
                               G/B               - D/F#
        with all of Your love;
     G                         D/F#
    Only You can make me
                     Em - A
        feel anew.

Chorus:
                                  G/B      A/C#          D
    My heart cries out to You, O Lord,
                           F#7                               Bm
    For You to take complete control
                     G - Em
    Of all I am;
                            D
    Take all of me.
                 G/B  A/C#         D
    The desire of my heart,
                                    F#7               Bm
        is that You’ll take every part
                          G - Em
    Of who I am,
                                   Asus4-A7        D
        and make me one with You.

2.    Have Your way inside my heart
        and change me,
    Lord, You are my potter;
        I’m Your clay.
    All I want to do, O God,
        is please You;
    Draw me close to You
        and don’t let go.

3.    This world and all I see
        will fade away soon;
    I am only passing through
        this place.
    The only love that never ends
        is Yours, Lord,
    So I give myself completely
        now to You.
