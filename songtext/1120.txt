2. You didn't want heaven
    without us,
   So, Jesus,
   You brought heaven down.
   My sin was great;
   Your love was greater.
   What could separate us now?

   What a wonderful name it is;
   What a wonderful name it is—

   What a wonderful name it is—
    The name of Jesus.


Bridge:
                    A
   Death could not hold You,
                    B
   The veil tore before You,
                    C#m7
   You silenced the boast
               G#m7
    of sin and grave.
                     A
   The heavens are roaring
                        B
   The praise of Your glory,
                C#m7             B
   For You are raised to life again.
                A

               B
   You have no equal.
              C#m7            G#m7
   Now and forever, God, You reign.

   Yours is the kingdom,
                  B
   Yours is the glory,

   Yours is the name
                B
    above all names.

   What a powerful name it is;
   What a powerful name it is—
   The name of Jesus Christ
    my King.
   What a powerful name it is;
   Nothing can stand against.
   What a powerful name it is—
   The name of Jesus.
