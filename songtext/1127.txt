1. My life is hid with Christ in God;
GD
I’m crucified with Him.
A7 D F#m Bm
O hope of glory—Christ in me,
Gm6-D/A A7 D
A new joy now within.

Chorus:
D A
Christ liveth in me!
Bm F#
Christ liveth in me!
G D/F#-Bm
Oh, great is this mystery,
Gm6 D/A A7 D
That Christ liveth in me.

2. Through grace accepted
drawn to Thee,
Beloved of my soul.
Eternal purpose now unveiled,
Makes me complete and whole.

3. Exceeding greatness of His power
To me hath He revealed;
Inheritance with saints in light
Is mine—in Him I’m sealed.

4. Kept in the mighty power of God,
With confidence enshrined.
Enriched with glory, treasure rare,
My life through Him refined.

5. Thy all-consuming love divine
Transforms my inner life.
Lo! Now my heart
enthralled by Thee,
Forsakes this world of strife.
