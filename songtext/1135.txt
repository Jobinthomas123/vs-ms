C 1. What gift of grace F/C
Is Jesus my redeemer;
C
There is no more
Gsus-G
For heaven now to give.
C
He is my joy,
C/F-Csus2/F
My righteousness, and freedom,
C/G
My steadfast love,
G7 Csus-C
My deep and boundless peace.
Fsus2
To this I hold,
C/E
my hope is only Jesus;
F
For my life
C/E Gsus-G
is wholly bound to His.
C Fsus2/D
Oh, how strange and divine;
C/E Fsus2
I can sing, all is mine—
C/G Gsus C
Yet not I, but through Christ in me.

2. The night is dark,
But I am not forsaken;
For by my side,
The Savior He will stay.
I labor on
In weakness and rejoicing,
For in my need
His power is displayed.
To this I hold,
My Shepherd will defend me;
Through the deepest valley
He will lead.
Oh, the night has been won,
And I shall overcome—
Yet not I,
but through Christ in me.

3. No fate I dread;
I know I am forgiven.
The future sure—
The price it has been paid;
For Jesus bled
And suffered for my pardon,
And He was raised
To overthrow the grave.
To this I hold,
My sin has been defeated;
Jesus now and ever is my plea.
Oh, the chains are released;
I can sing I am free—
Yet not I,
but through Christ in me.

4. With every breath
I long to follow Jesus,
For He has said
That He will bring me home.
And day by day
I know He will renew me,
Until I stand
With joy before the throne.
To this I hold,
my hope is only Jesus;
All the glory evermore to Him.
When the race is complete,
Still my lips shall repeat—
Yet not I,
but through Christ in me.
