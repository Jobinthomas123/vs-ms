                              G
    It’s coming down, down, down,

    It’s coming down.

    And, the glory of the Lord
                              D7
        is coming down.
                          G                             G7
    When the saints begin to pray,
                          C
    Then the Lord will have
                  Am7
        His way,
                        G                     D7
    And the glory of the Lord
                             G
        is coming down.
