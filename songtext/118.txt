       E   A        B7 E        —E7
    Because He lives,
                                  A        —F#7
        I can face tomorrow.
                              E      —C#m
    Because He lives,
                              F#7 —B7
        all fear is gone;
                             E  -  B7  -  E7
    Because I know,
                                   A    —F#7
        He holds the future,
                              E              C#7
    And life is worth the living
        F#7          B7           E
        just because He lives.
