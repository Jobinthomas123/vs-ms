    This is the coming
                       G
        of the promised Latter Rain;
      G7
    Lift up your eyes,
              C
        behold the ripened grain.

    Mighty signs and wonders
                                  F

                                               C
    Drink, O drink, My people,
          G                              C
    This is the Latter Rain.
