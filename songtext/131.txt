	               G                           C
	And, still the Lord is calling,
	                     G                               F-D7
	Reaching out for you and me.
	                    G                           C
	You can be one of His chosen;
	                      G                                 F
	When He calls, just follow Him,
	                          G
	Just follow Him.
