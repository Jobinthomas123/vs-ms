    Move on, brother,
          F
        move on, sister;
         C                                 G
    This is the moving day.
        C
    Move a little closer;
      F
    Take your stand with Jesus.
        C                  G                       C
    Move on, brother, move on.


    The move is on, my Lord,
                               G
        the move is on.
                             G7
    The move is on, my Lord,
                               C
        the move is on.

    I hear the rustle
                      F                Dm
        in the mulberry trees;
           G
    I know, I know,
                                           C
    I know the move is on.
