    Won’t you greet somebody
             F  G       C
        in Jesus’ name?

    Won’t you tell them

    That you love them
             F  G        C
        in Jesus’ name?

    Tell them we can work together
            F   G       C
        in Jesus’ name.

                               G
    Everybody smile –
                F            C
    Jesus loves you.
                               G
    Everybody smile –
                F            C
    Jesus loves you.
