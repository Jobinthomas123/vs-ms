   D                    D7
	Hallelujah! Jesus loves me.
	  G                     D          A
	Hallelujah! Jesus loves me,
	  D                     G                       D-A
	Not for any reason I can see.
	 D                          D7
	Even though I often stumble,
	       G                               D
	He takes me by the hand,
	                                         A
	And He leadeth me on
	                    D
		to victory!
