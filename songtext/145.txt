      D             A
1.    Seek ye first
               G                       D
        the kingdom of God
    G                D                 A
    And His righteousness.
    D                            A
    And all these things
                       G                       D
        shall be added unto you.
       G     D               A-D
    Hallelu, Hallelujah.

2.    Ask, and it shall be given unto you.
    Seek, and ye shall find.
    Knock, and the door shall be
        opened unto you.
    Hallelu, Hallelujah.

3.    Man shall not live by bread alone,
    But by every Word
    That proceeds from
        the mouth of God.
    Hallelu, Hallelujah.
