    Let the beauty of Jesus

        be seen in me—
    G7
    All His wondrous compassion
                  F—C
        and purity.

    O, Thou Spirit Divine,
      G7                           C
        all my nature refine,

    Till the beauty of Jesus
                      G     C
        be seen in me.
