                            A
1. When the trump
                                D/A A
		of the great archangel
                            E                    A
	Its mighty tones shall sound,
                      E7
	And the end of the world
                  A
		proclaiming,
                  B7
	Shall pierce the depths
                E
		profound,
                            A
	When the Son of Man
                    D                        A
		shall come in His glory,
                E7                             A
	With all the saints on high,
                                                     A7
	What a shouting in the skies
                             D
		from the multitudes that rise—
          A                           E7
	Changed in the twinkling
                  A
		of an eye.


Chorus
          A
	Changed in the twinkling
                  D
		of an eye,
	      B7
	Changed in the twinkling
                   E
		of an eye,
	            A
	The trumpet shall sound,
	            Bm
		the dead shall be raised,
	     E7
	Changed in the twinkling
	              A
		of an eye.


2. When He comes in the clouds
		descending,
	And they who loved Him here,
	From their graves shall awake,
		and praise Him
	With joy and not with fear;
	When the body and the soul
		are united,
	And clothed no more to die,
	What a shouting there will be
		when each other’s face we see—
	Changed in the twinkling
		of an eye.


3. Oh, the seed that was sown
		in weakness
	Shall then be raised in pow’r,
	And the songs of the saints
		perfected
	Shall hail that blissful hour.
	When we gather safely home
		in the morning,
	And night’s dark shadow fly,
	What a shouting on the shore
		when we meet to part no more—
	Changed in the twinkling of an eye
