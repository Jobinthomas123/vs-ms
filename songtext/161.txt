       A
1. When I see the city crystal,

	Bright with light of golden hues,

	Midst the throngs of

		pageants festal,
                       B7                                    E
	Singing songs unknown and new;
	                 A
	I shall praise through endless ages,

	With the harps prepared in Zion;

	Glory these in various stages,
	                           E                           A
	Shown the chosen sons of Zion.

Chorus
                       A-D                             A
	Take me to the heights of Zion;
                            E7                              A
	Take me where no night is known.
                              A7                           D
	There’s my home in restful Zion;
                    A-E                             A
	Trials make me more her own.

2. Paved with gold
		the street for faithful,
	For the saints from every land;
	Strongly guarded city peaceful,
	Built by God at His command.
	Garnished with the
		jewels precious,
	Her foundations are so rare;
	Those who bore the burden tell us,
	Them the precious stones declare.

3. Inward strength for
		reaching mountain,
	Tireless feet have dared to climb;
	Lo, their voice like
		gushing fountain,
	Mercy sounds like harps sublime.
	God hath chosen thee, O Zion,
	Glorious things are said of thee.
	Hid in mind of God was Zion,
	Which the saints do now foresee.

4. There the tree of life for victors,
	Luscious fruit of every kind,
	From the throne of God a river,
	To invigorate the mind.
	God of all creation reigneth—
	Father, Son and Holy Ghost;
	Blessed is the man that dwelleth
	With the unseen God of hosts.
