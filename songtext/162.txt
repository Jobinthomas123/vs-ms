1. O Lord, my God,
                               D                Bm —Bm7
        when I in awesome wonder
                         A             E
    Consider all the worlds
                  E7                     A
        Thy hands have made;
E                       A
    I see the stars,
                            D               Bm—Bm7
        I hear the rolling thunder,
                                           A
    Thy power throughout
                 E       E7           A
        the universe displayed.

Chorus
 E                                  A—A7
    Then sings my soul,
                 D            Bm            A—F#m
        my Savior God to Thee;
                                      Bm7
    How great Thou art!
 E                                    A   E
    How great Thou art!
                                      A—A7
    Then sings my soul,
                 D            Bm7          A—F#m
        my Savior God to Thee;
                                      Bm7
    How great Thou art!
 E                                   A
    How great Thou art!

2. When through the woods and
        forest glades I wander,
    And hear the birds
        sing sweetly in the trees,
    When I look down from
        lofty mountain grandeur,
    And hear the brook
        and feel the gentle breeze.

3. And when I think that God,
        His Son not sparing,
    Sent Him to die,
        I scarce can take it in—
    That on the cross,
        my burden gladly bearing,
    He bled and died
        to take away my sin.

4. When Christ shall come
        with shout of acclamation,
    And take me home,
        what joy shall fill my heart.
    Then I shall bow
        in humble adoration,
    And there proclaim: “My God,
        How great Thou art!”
