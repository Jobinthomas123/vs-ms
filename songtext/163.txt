             C                     C7
1. I’d rather have Jesus
                  F                C
        than silver or gold;

    I’d rather be His
                                               G-G7
        than have riches untold.
             C                    C7
    I’d rather have Jesus
                    F                C
        than houses or lands;

    I’d rather be led
                                G             C
        by His nail-pierced hand.

Chorus
                       G      G7
    Than to be a king
                   F           C
        of a vast domain,
                      G
    And be held
             G7                       F—C
        in sin’s dread sway;
            C                      C7
    I’d rather have Jesus
                  F       C
        than anything
                                G              C
    This world affords today.

2. He’s fairer than lilies of rarest hue;
    He’s sweeter than honey
        that’s out of the comb.
    He’s all that my hungering
        spirit needs;
    I’d rather have Jesus
        and let Him lead.

3. I’d rather have Jesus
        than men’s applause;
    I’d rather be faithful
        to His dear cross.
    I’d rather have Jesus
        than worldwide fame;
    I’d rather be true
        to His holy name.
