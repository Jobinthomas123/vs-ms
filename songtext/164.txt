1. Oft times the day seems long,
                 F                         C
        our trials hard to bear;
                   G7
    We’re tempted to complain,
               C
        to murmur and despair.

    But Christ will soon appear
              F                                C
        to catch His bride away;
            F                       C
    All tears forever over,
              Dm7           G7    C
        in God’s eternal day.

Chorus
                          F
    It will be worth it all
                                    C
        when we see Jesus;
                                      G7
    Life’s trials will seem so small
                                        C
        when we see Christ.
                                       F
    One glimpse of His dear face,
                               C
        all sorrow will erase;
                           Dm7        G7
    So bravely run the race
                                  C
        till we see Christ.

2. Sometimes the sky looks dark
        with not a ray of light;
    We’re tossed and driven on,
        no human help in sight.
    But there is One in heav’n
        Who knows our deepest care.
    Let Jesus solve your problem,
        just go to Him in pray’r.

3. Life’s day will soon be o’er,
        all storms forever past;
    We’ll cross the great divide
        to glory safe at last.
    We’ll share the joys of heav’n—
        a harp, a home, a crown;
    The tempter will be banished,
        we’ll lay our burden down.
