1. I traveled down a lonely road,
                F             Fm                C
    And no one seemed to care.
                                             Am
    The burden on my weary back
                D7                             G
    Had bowed me to despair.
        C                                   C7
    I oft complained to Jesus
                 F                     Fm           C
    How folks were treating me,

    And then I heard Him say
               G         C-C7
        so tenderly,
                  F                           Dm7
    “My feet were also weary
          C
    Upon the Calv’ry road,
                  F                              Dm7
    The cross became so heavy,
        D7                           G
    I fell beneath the load.
            C                            C7
    Be faithful, weary pilgrim
                F                          C
    The morning I can see.

    Just lift your cross
                               G            C
    And follow close to Me.”

2. “I work so hard for Jesus”,
    I often boast and say.
    “I’ve sacrificed a lot of things
    To walk the narrow way;
    I gave up fame and fortune,
    I’m worth a lot to Thee.”
    And then I hear Him gently
        say to me,
    “I left the throne of glory
    And counted it but loss;
    My hands were nailed in anger
    Upon a cruel cross.
    But now we’ll make the journey
    With your hand safe in Mine;
    So lift your cross
    And follow close to Me.”

3. Oh, Jesus, if I die upon
    A foreign field some day,
    ’Twould be no more
        than love demands—
    No less could I repay.
    “No greater love hath mortal man
    Than for a friend to die.”
    These are the words He gently
        spoke to me.
    “If just a cup of water
    I place within your hand,
    Then just a cup of water
    Is all that I demand.”
    But, if by death to living
    They can Thy glory see,
    I’ll take my cross
    And follow close to Thee.
