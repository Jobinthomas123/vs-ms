                        C
1. When I think about the cross
                          F                          C
		that my Savior had to bear,
                                 G7
	And how He died for me
                              C
		upon the tree,

	Then my heart with fervent plea
                             F                              C
		cries, “O Lord, it was for me,
                            G7
	Let me be worthy of the price
                                     C
		You paid for me.”

Chorus:
                             F
	Let me be worthy of the price
                                C
		that set me free;
                            G                           G7
	Let me be worthy of the blood
                                     C
		You shed for me.

	Let me be worthy of the pain
                            F                              C
		that You suffered for my gain;
                            G                         G7
	Let me be worthy of the price
                                     C
		You paid for me.

2. Oh, the beauty and the grace,
		love and pity on His face,
	All through His suff’ring
		and His awful pain,
	Made the thief upon the tree cry,
		“O Lord, remember me,
	Let me be worthy, let me
		someday with You reign.”

3. Oh, what mercy and what love,
		as He prayed to God above,
	“Forgive them for they know not
		what they do!”
	In my heart there rings a prayer,
		let me of His mercy share!
	Let me be worthy of the price
		He paid for me.
