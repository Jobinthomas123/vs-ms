		Thy compassions, they fail not.

                         G7              C
		Thou forever wilt be.

	Join with all nature in
		manifold witness,
	To Thy great faithfulness,
		mercy and love.

3. Pardon for sin and a
		peace that endureth,
	Thy own dear presence to cheer
		and to guide;
	Strength for today and bright
		hope for tomorrow,
	Blessings all mine,
		with ten thousand beside!
