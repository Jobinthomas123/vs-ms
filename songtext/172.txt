   The Lord has made me happy
       C—Am
    today.
        F                G
   The Lord has made me happy
       C—Am
    today.

   This is how I feel inside,
          C              Am
    and this is what I pray—
             F
   That the Lord will
              G       C
    make you happy today.

    F               G        C-Am
1. Yesterday I was lonely inside;
          F              G      C-Am
   I was sad and to the Lord I cried.
         F                G
   But, God is great, He loves us so;
       C             Am
   He healed my misery.
       F
   He turned it into love
         G              C
    and set my spirit free!

2. Jesus set my feet on solid ground;
   I want to show the world
    this wondrous love I’ve found.
   For, in the love of God
   There’s no beginning and no end;
   Jesus knows just how to be
    a friend.
