1. Onward, Christian soldiers!
        G7                         C
	Marching as to war,

	See, His banners go!

2. Like a mighty army
	Moves the church of God.
	Brothers, we are treading
	Where the saints have trod.
	We are not divided,
	All one body we;
	One in hope and doctrine,
	One in charity.

3. Crowns and thrones may perish,
	Kingdoms rise and wane;
	But the church of Jesus
	Constant will remain.
	Gates of hell can never
	‘Gainst that church prevail;
	We have Christ’s own promise,
	Which can never fail.

4. Onward, then, ye people!
	Join our happy throng;
	Blend with ours your voices
	In the triumph song.
	Glory, laud, and honor,
	Unto Christ the King;
	This thro’ countless ages
	Men and angels sing.
