         C           F
1. How sweet are the tidings
            C
    that greet the pilgrim’s ear
                    Am
   As he wanders an exile
          Dm-G
    from home;
            C             F
   For he knows that his King
              C             Am
    from the heav’n shall appear
       C          Dm
   To gather all those
        G    C
    who overcome.

Chorus:
         C
   How great a calling,
           F         Dm7
    this great high calling—
        C                  Am7
   Eye hath not seen its treasures;
             D7                 G
   Ear hath not its greatness heard.
         C
   What God hath stored

    for pilgrims,
       F               Dm7
   No moth nor rust corroding,
         C              F
   There is a lasting kingdom
          G             C
    that never shall be marred.

2. The grave not the goal
    that blasts the pilgrim’s hope,
   As he labors for sinners to save;
   For he knows that on earth,
    wide the field of his scope,
   As he tells of the One
    Who forgave.

3. The world not his gain
    that robs the vision great,
   As he spends and is spent
    for his Lord;
   For he looks not to man
    that his cause vindicate,
   While he works with the saints
    in one accord.

4. He seeks not his own,
    be it comfort, selfish gain,
   For the Lord he is seeking
    to please;
   And his thoughts are afar,
    in His kingdom to reign,
   What he sows now the Lord
    will increase.

5. Blessed hope of the saint
    anchored now within the veil,
   Gives sweet peace and a rest
    in the storm.
   As the trials perfect now
    there is nought to bewail,
   While he waits for the trumpet
    to inform.
