1. Beneath the cross of Jesus
           Dm                G                 C
		I fain would take my stand,
                Am                   F            Dm
	The shadow of a mighty Rock
           Gm          B         E7
		within a weary land;
           C              Am            C         C7
	A home within the wilderness,
             F        Dm           G
		a rest upon the way,
                           G7
	From the burning
                      C               Am
		of the noontide heat
                         C          G            C
	And the burden of the day.

2. Upon that cross of Jesus
		mine eye at times can see
	The very dying form of One
		Who suffered there for me;
	And from my smitten heart
		with tears two wonders I confess,
	The wonders of redeeming love
		and my unworthiness.

3. I take, O cross, thy shadow
		for my abiding place;
	I ask no other sunshine
		than the sunshine of His face.
	Content to let the world go by,
		to know no gain nor loss,
	My sinful self my only shame,
		my glory all the cross.
