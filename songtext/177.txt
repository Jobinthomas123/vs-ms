1. I know not why

		God’s wondrous grace
                                                 G
	To me He hath made known,
                   C
	Nor why, unworthy,

		Christ in love
             G                  G7           C
	Redeemed me for His own.

Chorus:
	  C7        F
	But I know Whom
                           C
		I have believed, and
                     G                                C
	Am persuaded that He is able
             F
	To keep that which
                         C
		I’ve committed
                G           G7                 C
	Unto Him against that day.

2. I know not how this saving faith
	To me He did impart,
	Nor how believing in His Word
	Wrought peace within my heart.

3. I know not how the Spirit moves,
	Convincing men of sin,
	Revealing Jesus thro’ the Word,
	Creating faith in Him.

4. I know not when
		my Lord may come,
	At night or noonday fair,
	But when He comes I’ll go
		with Him
	To meet Him in the air!
