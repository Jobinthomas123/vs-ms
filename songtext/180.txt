1. Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
                G   D/F#-  Em   D        A
	And did my  Sov’reign die?
                      D
	Would he devote that

		sacred head
	          A                          D
	For such a worm as I?

Chorus:
                       D
	At the cross, at the cross
                       A
	Where I first saw the light,
                        A7
	And the burden of my heart
                         D
		rolled away,
                      G             Em
	It was there by faith
                D                  Bm
		I received my sight,
               Em              A7
	And now I am happy
                       D
		all the day!

2. Was it for crimes that I have done,
	He groaned upon the tree?
	Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
	And love beyond degree!

3. Well might the sun
		in darkness hide,
	And shut his glories in,
	When Christ, the mighty
		Maker, died
	For man the creature’s sin.

4. But drops of grief can ne’er repay
	The debt of love I owe:
	Here, Lord, I give myself away,
	‘Tis all that I can do!
