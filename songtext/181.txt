1. Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
          A
   He’ll help you along,
     D
    help you along.

   If you will trust His love unfailing,
          A         A7         D
   He’ll fill your heart with song.

Chorus:
    D
   Lean on His arms,
                     A
    trusting in His love;
   A7
   Lean on His arms,
                      D
    all His mercies prove.
               D7
   Lean on His arms,
     G             Em
    looking home above;
         D           A       D
   Just lean on the Savior’s arms.

2. Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   He’ll brighten the way,
    brighten the way.
   Just follow gladly
    where He leadeth,
   His gentle voice obey.

3. Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   Oh, bring every care,
    bring every care.
   The burden that hath
    seemed so heavy,
   Take to the Lord in prayer.

4. Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   Then leave all to Him,
    leave all to Him.
   His heart is full
    of love and mercy,
   His eyes are never dim.

5. Just lean upon the arms of Jesus;
   He meets every need,
    meets every need.
   To all who take Him as a Savior,
   He is a friend indeed!
