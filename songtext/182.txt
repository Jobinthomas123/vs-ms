       D          D7              G                Em
1. Jesus, keep me near the cross—
          D                                    A7
	There a precious fountain
          D       D7        G                  Em
	Free to all, a healing stream,
          D                             A7                D
		flows from Calv’ry’s mountain.

Chorus:
                      D7     G             Em
	In the cross, in the cross,
         D                        A7
		be my glory ever,
       D            D7              G                Em
	Till my raptured soul shall find
          D                      A  A7-D
		rest beyond the river.

2. Near the cross, a trembling soul,
		love and mercy found me.
	There the Bright and Morning Star
		sheds its beams around me.

3. Near the cross I’ll watch and wait—
		hoping, trusting ever,
	Till I reach the golden strand,
		just beyond the river.
