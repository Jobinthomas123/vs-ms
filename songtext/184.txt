1.    Take my life and let it be,
       Bm           G        D      A7     D
    Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
       D                 A             A7              G/D - D
    Take my moments and my days;

    Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
       D      Em  D/F#  G    D/A  A7       D
    Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

2.    Take my hands and let them move
    At the impulse of Thy love.
    Take my feet and let them be
    Swift and beautiful for Thee,
    Swift and beautiful for Thee.

3. Take my voice and let me sing
    Always only for my King.
    Take my lips and let them be
    Filled with messages from Thee,
    Filled with messages from Thee.

4. Take my silver and my gold;
    Not a mite would I withhold.
    Take my intellect and use
    Every power as Thou shalt choose,
    Every power as Thou shalt choose.

5. Take my will and make it Thine;
    It shall be no longer mine.
    Take my heart; it is Thine own.
    It shall be Thy royal throne.
    It shall be Thy royal throne.

6. Take my love, my Lord, I pour,
    At Thy feet its treasure store.
    Take myself and I will be
    Ever only all for Thee,
    Ever only all for Thee.
