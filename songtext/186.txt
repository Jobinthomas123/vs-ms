            D – D4        D
1.    It matters so little how much
          D4             D
        you may own,
                   D                      G/D
    The places you’ve been and
                Em7                         A7
        the people you’ve known.
                   Em7                   A7
    For, it all comes to nothing when
           Em7                 A7
        placed at His feet;
                         Em7             A7
    It means nothing to Jesus—
                   Em7   A7           D
        just mem’ries to keep.

Chorus:
Am -D–G                 Em
            Only one life—
          F#m7              B7
        soon it will pass;
      Em                     A7
    Only what’s done
                   D      Am7   D7
        for Christ will last.
      G                   Em           F#m7      B7
    Only one chance to do His will—
             Em7                  A7
    So give to Jesus all your days;
    F#m7                 B7
    It’s the only life that pays
                   Em7
    When you recall
                  A7                      D
        you have but one life.

2.    You can have all the treasures
        from faraway lands.
    You can have all the wealth you can hold in your hands.
    You can have all the pleasures
        that money can buy,
    But what will you have when it’s
        your turn to die?

3.    The days pass so swiftly;
        the months come and go.
    The years melt away as the
        new fallen snow.
    Spring turns to summer
        and summer to fall;
    Autumn brings winter
        and death comes to all.
