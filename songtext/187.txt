               D
1.    My Jesus, I know
                          G                D
    Thou art mine evermore.

    Though man changeth,
                                     A
    Thou changeth not.
               D                     D7
    The saints ever trust Thee
                   G           Em
        and gladly adore,
                  D                     A7       D
    For Thou art Jehovah-Jireh.

Chorus:
            D
    O Lord, Thou art mine;
                  A7                         D
    Dear Lord, Thou art mine.
                                                                    D
    I’ll follow where’er Thou dost go.
                                          D7
    The world and its cares
                          G           Em
        all on Thee I resign;
                  D                                    A7    D
    Thy graces shall through me flow.

2.    On Calvary’s tree
        all my sins Thou didst bear
    And carried my sicknesses too.
    I’m healed by Thy stripes;
    Now Thy mercies I share,
    For Thou art Jehovah-Rapha.

3.    In life’s battles Thou girdest me
        with Thy strength;
    My enemies Thou hast subdued.
    With banner victorious
    Thou leadest me forth,
    For Thou art Jehovah-Nissi.

4.    Mine eyes will I lift up
        to Thee, O my God,
    When storms and wild tempests
        do blow.
    Thy peace like a river
        is calm and so broad,
    For Thou art Jehovah-Shalom.

5.    Sweet Shepherd that feedeth
        my soul every day,
    Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me.
    I rest at Thy feet
        lest I wander away,
    For Thou art Jehovah-Ra’ah.

6.    Moving by faith
        into Thy righteousness,
    Thy Gospel I preach
        without shame.
    And, worship Thee, Lord,
        in Thy true holiness—
    Thou art Jehovah-Tsidkenu.

7.    Thy presence is joyous
        and sweet to my soul;
    My lips shall now
        show forth Thy praise.
    To dwell with the saints
        on Mount Zion is my goal,
    For Thou art  Jehovah-Shammah.
