               D
1.    Oh, give me a faith
                     A
        that is active and patient,
                  D
    That trusts in Thy power
                                           A
        to keep me from harm;
           D                          G
    In fiery trials that I may

        be radiant,
                  D
    And trust in Thy love
                        A
        and be calm.

Chorus:
              D
    I’ll trust Thee
          A                           D
        with my whole heart;
                            G                      D
    I’ll never from Thee depart.
          G
    I know Thou art keeping me
         D                   Bm
        safe in Thy arms,
                      D                A7                D
    And I know I’m free from alarms.

2.    Oh, give me a faith
        that is bold and triumphant
    In perils and sword
        and all famine and pain;
    A faith that is steadfast,
        forever persistent,
    O’er Satan the victory to gain.

3.    Oh, give me Thy faith, Lord,
        for this I beseech Thee;
    I long to be earnest,
        strong-hearted and true.
    With Thee I shall conquer;
        no evil can touch me.
    My Lord, I shall surely
        win through.

4.    Assailed by wild tempests
        along my life’s voyage,
    When peace and all safety
        begin to depart;
    Lord, strengthen my faith,
        for Thy Word is my courage;
    And it will a new grace impart.

5.    Thy faith that is precious
        to me Thou hast given—
    The faith that will master
        the wind and the wave.
    My anchor is cast now
        within the veil riven;
    By Thee I am mighty and brave.
