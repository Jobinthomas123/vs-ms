Chorus:
                 Dm
    The Lord is my strength and song
                                  - C     Bb    C -   Dm
    And He is become my salvation!

    He is my God and I will

        prepare Him an habitation.
              A7
    My father’s God and
                        Dm
        I will exalt Him!

    Gm                                   Dm
1.    He hath triumphed gloriously;
                                              D7
    I will sing unto the Lord.
    Gm                                    Dm
    He hath triumphed gloriously;
               A7
    The horse and his rider

    Hath He cast into the sea.

2.    The Lord is a Man of war;
    The Lord is His name.
    Pharaoh’s chariots and his host
    He cast in the depths of the sea!

3.    Thy right hand, O Lord,
    Is become glorious in pow’r;
    Thy right hand, O Lord,
    Hath cast in pieces the enemy.

4.    Who is like unto Thee,
    O Lord, among the gods?
    Who is like Thee,
        glorious in holiness,
    Fearful in praises
        doing wonders?
