		through and through.

	Oh, the Holy Ghost will set
                                 G           - Em
		your feet a dancing,

1.	David danced before the Lord;
               A7
		he danced with all his mighty.

	His heart was filled with holy joy;
                   A                    D
		his spirit was so light.

	Michal through

		the window looked,
                G                     Em
		to criticize did start,
               A
	She didn’t understand that David
          A7                        D
		had a dancing heart.

2.	David danced before the Lord
		to magnify His name.
	In God’s almighty presence,
		he felt no sense of shame.
	The oil of gladness flowed that
		day; it quickened every part.
	He hadn’t only dancing feet!
		he had a dancing heart.

3.	Out of Egypt long ago
		the Israelites were led,
	And by a mighty miracle
		they all were kept and fed.
	Through the Red sea
		they were brought;
	The waters stood apart,
	And God gave sister Miriam
		a dance down in her heart.

4.	There was a celebration
		upon the Red Sea shore;
	Timbrels rang and desert sands
		became a dancing floor.
	The people sang
		and praised God there;
	He made the gloom depart,
	And put a dance of love and joy,
		a-deep down in their hearts.

5.	The prodigal was far away,
		wand’ring out in sin.
	But, he came back to
		father’s house,
	And father took him in.
	He put a robe upon his son;
		the merriment did start.
	The prodigal got dancing shoes
		to match his dancing heart.

6.	The father’s house with music
		rang to welcome home the son;
	Wine was flowing full and free,
		all misery was gone.
	The elder brother looking on
		complained it wasn’t fair.
	He hadn’t got a dancing heart
		like all the others there.

7.	Now many saints are cold
		and bound by unbelief today;
	They want the blessing of the Lord
		but worry what men say.
	Oh, let the Lord have full control;
		from dead traditions part.
	And, He will set you free within;
		you’ll have a dancing heart.

8.	Now in the Bible we can read
		that in the latter days
	Men would leave their first love,
		yes, and turn to carnal ways.
	But, true-born saints of Jesus,
		for the Bridegroom set apart,
	Are waiting for His coming,
		with a joyful dancing heart.
