           G
1.    I come to the garden alone
                            C
    While the dew is still
                       G
        on the roses,
                        D7
    And the voice I hear,
                      G
        falling on my ear,
                A7                          D–A-D7
    The Son of God discloses.

Chorus:
                         G
    And He walks with me,
                       D7
    And He talks with me,
                       Am7
    And He tells me
       D7              G
        I am His own.
                                         B7
    And the joy we share
                     C          A7
        as we tarry there,
                  G               D7         G
    None other has ever known.

2.    He speaks and the sound
        of His voice
    Is so sweet
        the birds hush their singing.
    And the melody
        that He gave to me
    Within my heart is ringing.

3.    I’d stay in the garden with Him,
    Tho’ the night around me be falling.
    But He bids me go thro’ the voice of woe;
    His voice to me is calling.
