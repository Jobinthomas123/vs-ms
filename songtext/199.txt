      D                       A     D
1.    Jesus loves me, this I know,
       G                                  D
    For the Bible tells me so.
                            A    D
    Little ones to Him belong;
          G              D                     A       D
    They are weak, but He is strong.

Chorus:
       D                  G
    Yes, Jesus loves me.
      D                                 A
    Yes, Jesus loves me.
       D                  G
    Yes, Jesus loves me;
                D                    A   D
    The Bible tells me so.

2.    Jesus loves me, He Who died,
    Heaven’s gate to open wide.
    He will wash away my sin;
    Let His little child come in.

3.    Jesus loves me, loves me still,
    Though I’m very weak and ill.
    From His shining Throne on high,
    Comes to watch me where I lie.

4.    Jesus loves me; He will stay
    Close beside me all the way.
    If I love Him, when I die,
    He will take me home on high.
