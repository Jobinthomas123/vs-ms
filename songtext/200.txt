          E                 B7         E
1.    I need Thee ev’ry hour,
                      A               E
        most gracious Lord;
              B7                                E
    No tender voice like Thine
                   B       F#      -B7
        can peace afford.

Chorus:
           E                   A           B7
    I need Thee; oh, I need Thee!
                                  E
    Ev’ry hour I need Thee!
                 A                                 E
    Oh, bless me now, my Saviour,
   B7   E      B7      E
    I come to Thee!

2. I need Thee ev’ry hour;
        stay Thou near by.
    Temptations lose their pow’r
        when Thou art nigh.

3. I need Thee ev’ry hour
        in joy or pain;
    Come quickly and abide,
        or life is vain.

4.    I need Thee ev’ry hour,
        most Holy One;
    Oh, make me Thine indeed,
        Thou blessed Son.
