          E
1.	There was no crown for Him
                               E4   E
		of silver or of gold.
                                   B
	There was no diadem for Him
               E
		to hold.

	But blood adorned His brow
                                                E4   E
		and proud its stain He bore,
                                 B7
	And sinners gave to Him
                                       E
		the crown He wore.

Chorus:
                            A
	A rugged cross,
                                      E
		became His throne.
                                  B7
	His kingdom was
                              E
		in hearts alone.
                                  A
	He wrote His love
                                E
		in crimson red,
                                     B7
	And wore the thorns
                             E
		upon His head.

2.	He did not reign upon
		a throne of ivory,
	But died upon the cross
		of Calvary.
	For sinners there He counted
		all He owned but loss,
	And He surveyed His kingdom
		from a cross.

3.	No purple robe He wore,
		His bleeding wounds to hide,
	But stripes upon His back
		He wore with pride.
	And from the wounds there flowed
	A crimson, cleansing stream,
	That was a cover for the
		soul unclean.
