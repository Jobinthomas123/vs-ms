        E                           B7
1.    Faith will ever triumph
                         E
        all the way;
       A                                 E
    Faith will look to Jesus
                        B7
        day by day
         E         E7             A
    Never fearing what the foes
                  F#m
        may say—
         E              B7                      E
    Walking alone with Jesus.

Chorus:
   B7           E                       E7
    I am walking with Jesus;
                       A                             E
    There’s nothing now to fear.
                                            C#m
    I am walking with Jesus.
                       F#                         B7
    There’s none to me so dear.
                  E                        E7
    I am walking with Jesus;
              A                       E
    He wipeth ev’ry tear.

    I am walking in the steps
                B7-E
       of Jesus.

2.    When the storms of life
        are raging wild,
    Faith will ever grow
        in meekness mild
    Knowing that the Lord
        will keep His child—
    Walking alone with Jesus.

3.    Faith will never stagger in the test,
    Casting all on Jesus, ever rest;
    Singing all the time,
        it knows the best—
    Walking alone with Jesus.

4.    Left alone to fight when all forsake,
    Trusting in His Word
        what e’er betake,
    Faith will surely
        every barrier break—
    Walking alone with Jesus.

5.    Faith alone will please
        the Lord of love;
    By it were the saints
        of God approved.
    Faith gives them a witness
        from above—
    Walking alone with Jesus.
