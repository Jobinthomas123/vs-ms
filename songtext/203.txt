1.    Jesus stands amongst us

        as the great Healer

    For the sick in body,
                            B7
        soul and mind;
                         E
    He was bruised,
                           E7
        He was wounded,
                    A                               F#m7
    So that in Him you may find
                      E                 B7         E
    Perfect healing of every kind.

Chorus:
     E
    All your weakness,

        all your sorrow,

    All your sicknesses
                     B7
        were laid on Him.
        E
    Come believing,

        never doubting,
                                                B7    E
    There’s abundant life in Him.

2.    Jesus stands amongst us
        with mighty power,
    And as ointment poured forth
        is His name.
    He can free you from all your care
    And make you fully whole—
    Changing never, the great ‘I AM’.

3.    Jesus stands amongst us
        with deep compassion,
    Eagerly to touch
        the suffering ones.
    Sorely scourged, He has suffered,
    And He knows your every need.
    Healing virtue from Him
        e’er comes.

4.    Jesus stands amongst us,
        despised, rejected
    On the cross with bleeding
        hands and feet.
    As the serpent that Moses
        in the desert lifted up,
    Christ has taken
        the curse complete.
