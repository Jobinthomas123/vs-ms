                  E
1.    Far away in the depths
                         A          E
        of my spirit tonight,

      Rolls a melody
             F#7                  B7
        sweeter than psalm.
                E
    In celestial-like strains
                  A
        it unceasingly falls
                         E
    O’er my soul like an
       B7             E
        infinite calm.

Chorus:
       E             E7
    Peace! Peace!
            A                  E
        Wonderful peace,

    Coming down from
                 F#7         B7
        the Father above,
                   E                   E7
    Sweep over my spirit
              E               F#m7
        forever, I pray,
            E                    B7                E
    In fathomless billows of love.

2.    What a treasure I have
        in this wonderful peace
    Buried deep in the
        heart of my soul.
    So secure that no power can
        mine it away,
    While the years of eternity roll.

3.    I am resting tonight
        in this wonderful peace,
    Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control.
    For I’m kept from all danger
        by night and by day,
    And His glory is flooding my soul.

4.    And to think when
    I rise to that city of peace,
    Where the Author of peace
        I shall see,
    That one strain of the song
        which the ransomed will sing,
    In that heavenly kingdom shall be.
