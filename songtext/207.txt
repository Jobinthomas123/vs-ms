               E
1.	My hope is built
                                B7
		on nothing less
                   A
	Than Jesus’ blood
                 E      B7       E
		and righteousness;

	I dare not trust
                    B7
		the sweetest frame
                   A
	But wholly lean on
         E  B7      E
		Jesus’ name.

Chorus:
                   E                          A
	On Christ, the solid Rock,

		I stand;
            E
	All other ground is
                         B7
		sinking sand.
            E
	All other ground is
         B7           E
		sinking sand.

2.	When darkness seems
		to hide His face,
	I rest on His unchanging grace;
	In ev’ry high and stormy gale,
	My anchor holds within the veil.

3.	His oath, His covenant, His blood,
	Support me in the whelming flood;
	When all around
		my soul gives way,
	He then is all my hope and stay.

4.	When He shall come
		with trumpet sound,
	Oh, may I then in Him be found;
	Dressed in His
		righteousness alone,
	Faultless to stand
		before the throne.
