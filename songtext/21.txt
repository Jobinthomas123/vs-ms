          |G|          |D|*7*
For He is able, He’s able,
    |G|             |C|
I know my Lord is able.
    |G|             |D|*7*
I know my Lord is able
               |G|
To carry me through. *x2*

            |C|
For He has healed the

  broken-hearted
     |G|
And set the captives free;
      |A|*7*
He’s healed the sick,

And raised the dead,
     |D|          |A|*7*      |D|*7*
And walked on troubled seas.

          |G|          |D|*7*
For He is able, He’s able,
   |G|               |C|
I know my Lord is able.
    |G|             |D|*7*
I know my Lord is able
               |G|
To carry me through.
