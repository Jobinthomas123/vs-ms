1. Oh, for a thousand tongues
    B7  E
    to sing
  B7     E      A E     B7
   My great Redeemer’s praise—
         E            A
   The glories of my God and King,
         E          B7   E
   The triumphs of His grace.

2. My gracious Master and my God,
   Assist me to proclaim—
   To spread through
    all the earth abroad,
   The honors of Thy name.

3. Jesus, the name that charms
    our fears,
   That bids our sorrows cease,
   ‘Tis music in the sinner’s ears;
   ‘Tis life and health and peace.

4. He breaks the power
    of cancelled sin;
   He sets the pris’ner free.
   His blood can make the foulest
    clean;
   His blood availed for me.

5. Hear Him, ye deaf!
    His praise, ye dumb,
   Your loosened tongues employ.
   Ye blind, behold your Savior
    comes;
   And leap, ye lame, for joy!
