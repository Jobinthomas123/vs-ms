1.    I want my life to be
                                    F#m                E
        all filled with praise to Thee,
                                  B7
    My precious Lord divine
                           Edim E
        Who died for me.
                   E4      E               F#m – B7
    Let all my will be Thine—
                                    F#m       E
        controlled by love divine.
                              A             E
    Live out in me Thy life,

        O mighty Savior.

Chorus:
      E                                    B7
    Thy blessed will divine;
                                F#m       E
        with joy I make it mine.
                                                       B7
    My heart shall be Thy throne,
                                E
        and Thine alone.
                                 E4     E           F#m – B7
    Choose Thou the path I tread
                                           E
        and whither I am led,
                              A           E
    Help me to follow on,
                A    E     B7 - E
        O mighty Savior.

2.    A pilgrim born anew,
        a stranger passing through,
    Not of this world am I,
        since I am Thine.
    Weaned from its passing show,
        transformed Thy love to know,
    Hold Thou my hand in Thine,
        O mighty Savior.

3.    When evil foes assail
        and almost would prevail,
    In that dark hour be Thou
        my strength and shield.
    Lend then Thy strong embrace,
        uphold me by Thy grace,
    In weakness be my strength,
        O mighty Savior.

4.    Yea, choose the path for me,
        although I may not see
    The reason Thou dost will
        to lead me so.
    I know the toilsome way
        will lead to realms of day
    Where I shall dwell with Thee,
        O mighty Savior.
