1.    Search me, O God,
                                      B7           E
        and know my heart today;
       A                   E – C#m7
    Try me, O Savior,
             F#m7        B                   B7
        know my thoughts, I pray.
       E    A              E
    See if there be some wicked
          B7           E
        way in me;
         A                            E          A
    Cleanse me from ev’ry sin,
               F#m7 B7  E
        and set me free.

2.    I praise Thee, Lord,
        for cleansing me from sin;
    Fulfill Thy Word,
        and make me pure within.
    Fill me with fire, where once I
        burned with shame;
    Grant my desire to magnify
        Thy name.

3.    Lord, take my life,
        and make it wholly Thine;
    Fill my poor heart
        with Thy great love divine.
    Take all my will, my passion,
        self and pride;
    I now surrender, Lord,
        in me abide.

4.    O Holy Ghost,
        revival comes from Thee;
    Send a revival —
        start the work in me.
    Thy Word declares Thou wilt
        supply our need;
    For blessing now, O Lord,
        I humbly plead.
