                                E                             A
1.	I’m pressing on the upward way;
                                          E
	New heights I’m gaining every
          B7
		day.
                               E                             A
	Still praying as I’m onward bound,
                                        E
	“Lord, plant my feet
                      B7      E
		on higher ground.”

Chorus:
                                E                            B7
	Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
                                                            E
	By faith, on heaven’s table-land—
                           E7                             A
	A higher plane than I have found.
                                     E
	Lord, plant my feet
                       B7    E
		on higher ground.

2.	My heart has no desire to stay
	Where doubts arise
		and fears dismay.
	Tho’ some may dwell
		where these abound,
	My prayer, my aim,
		is higher ground.

3.	I want to live above the world,
	Tho’ Satan’s darts at me are hurled.
	For, faith has caught
		the joyful sound,
	The song of saints
		on higher ground.

4.	I want to scale the utmost height
	And catch a gleam of glory bright.
	But, still I’ll pray
		till heav’n I’ve found,
	“Lord, lead me on
		to higher ground.”
