Chorus:
                      E
	We’re marching to Zion,
                                               B7
	Beautiful, beautiful Zion.
                        E
	We’re marching upward
                 A- F#m7
		to Zion,
                 E               B              E
	The beautiful city of God.

2.	 Let those refuse to sing
	Who never knew our God;
	But children of the heav’nly King,
	But children of the heav’nly King,
	May speak their joys abroad,
	May speak their joys abroad.

3.	The hill of Zion yields
	A thousand sacred sweets
	Before we reach
		the heav’nly fields,
	Before we reach
		the heav’nly fields,
	Or walk the golden streets,
	Or walk the golden streets.

4.	Then let our songs abound
	And ev’ry tear be dry.
	We’re marching thro’
		Emmanuel’s ground,
	We’re marching thro’
		Emmanuel’s ground,
	To fairer worlds on high,
	To fairer worlds on high.
