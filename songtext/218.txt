                 E
1.	I am looking for the dawning

	When the shadows flee away,

	And our Lord shall come in glory,
                       F#                               B7
	Then to catch His bride away.
                       E                                   E7
	Oh, my heart is filled with rapture
                 A                                      E
	As I wait and watch and pray,
                                                      B7
	For our Lord is coming back to
                          E
        earth again!

Chorus:
                       E
	What a gathering,

	What a gathering in the air—

	Changed in His own likeness,
                                   B7
		glorious and fair.
                       E
	What a gathering,
	                   E7
    What a greeting,
                             A                            E
	When we meet Him in the air;
                                                   B7
	Hallelujah, when our Jesus
                          E
		comes again!

2.	When the sealing work is finished
	And the bride is clothed in white,
	Then the ransomed of the Lord
		shall sing
	From Zion’s mountain height.
	In the glorious reign of Jesus,
	Where there’s love
		and pure delight;
	When our Jesus shall come back
		to earth again!

3.	Oh, our hearts will thrill
		with rapture
	As we see those mansions fair
	And the patriarchs and prophets,
	And the loved ones gathered there.
	We shall see His beauty
	And behold the land that is afar
	When our Jesus shall come back
		to earth again!

4.	Oh, be ready for His coming;
	Soon you’ll hear the midnight cry.
	If your consecration slackens,
	Then the Lord will pass you by.
	Oh, the door forever
		will be closed—
	No more to enter in
	When our Jesus shall come back
		to earth again!

5.	Where the glory of our God
	Doth shine in city crystal fair,
	Sin and sorrow, pain and sickness,
	They can never enter there.
	We shall have the
		Marriage Supper
	In the palace of the King.
	And with Jesus we’ll come back
		to earth again.
