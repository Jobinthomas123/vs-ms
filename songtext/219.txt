Chorus:
           E                                A
    Greater is He that is in me.
          B7                               E
    Greater is He that is in me.
                                         E7 A   – F#m
    Greater is He that is in me,
                B7                               E
    Than he that is in the world!

       E           E/G#     A            F#m
1.    Satan’s like a roaring lion
         B7                          E
        roaming to and fro,
                            E/G#       A           F#m
    Seeking whom he may devour
                 B7                       E
        the Bible tells me so.
         E                    E/G#   A             F#m
    Many souls have been his prey
              B7                                E
        to fall in some weak hour,
                 E                      E/G# A     F#m
    But God has promised us today
             B7                       E
    His overcoming pow’r.

2.    On the day of Pentecost
        a rushing mighty wind
    Blew into the upper room
        and baptized all of them.
    With a power greater than
        any earthly foe,
    And I’m so glad I’ve got it too,
    I’m gonna let the
        whole world know!
