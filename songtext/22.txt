         |C|
If that same Spirit
                             |G|
That raised Christ from the dead
          |G|*7*            |C|
Dwell in you, dwell in you;

If that same Spirit
                             |G|
That raised Christ from the dead
          |G|*7*            |C|
Dwell in you, dwell in you;
               |F|
Then He shall quicken
               |C|
  your mortal bodies,
          |G|*7*             |C|
If that Spirit dwell in you.
              |F|
And He shall quicken
               |C|
  your mortal bodies,
          |G|*7*            |C|
If that Spirit dwell in you.
