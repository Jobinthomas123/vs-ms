Chorus:
          E
	Spirit of God coming down

		from heaven

	Like a little white dove
                  F#            B7
		so fresh and free.
        E
	Heavenly Father, send the
           A         E
		Holy Spirit like a
	  A                      E
	Little white dove,
                               B7         E
		come and baptize me.

                    E
1.	When Jesus was baptized
                       A         E
		in the River Jordan,

	The Holy Spirit came
          F#                    B7
		down from above.
                E
	The heavens were opened
                        A               E
		as the Spirit descended;

	It rested upon Him
                                   B7     E
		like a little white dove.

2.	Now Jesus, He promised
		that He’d never leave us;
	Our comfort would come from His Spirit of love.
	He promised He’d send us
		down His spiritual power
	After He ascended to
		His Father above.
