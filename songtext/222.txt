1.    Have you been to Jesus

        for the cleansing power?
                                                      Em
    Are you washed in the blood
                        Am – D7
        of the Lamb?
                       G
    Are you fully trusting
                        C                Am
        in His grace this hour?
                          G
    Are you washed in the blood
        D           G
        of the Lamb?

Chorus:
                         G                           C - Am
    Are you washed in the blood,
                   G                             Em
    In the soul-cleansing blood
                        Am – D7
        of the Lamb?
                         G
    Are your garments spotless?
                            C            Am
    Are they white as snow?
                           G
    Are you washed in the blood
        D           G
        of the Lamb?

2.    Are you walking daily
        by the Savior’s side?
    Are you washed in the blood
        of the Lamb?
    Do you rest each moment
        in the Crucified?
    Are you washed in the blood
        of the Lamb?

3.    When the Bridegroom cometh
        will your robes be white?
    Are you washed in the blood
        of the Lamb?
    Will your soul be ready
        for the mansions bright?
    And be washed in the blood
        of the Lamb?

4.    Lay aside the garments
        that are stained with sin.
    Are you washed in the blood
        of the Lamb?
    There’s a fountain flowing
        for the soul unclean;
    Oh, be washed in the blood
        of the Lamb.
