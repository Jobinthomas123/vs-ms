1.    I came to Jesus
           Am        D7              G
        weary, worn, and sad;
             D7
    He took my sins away.
              G
    He took my sins away.
                                                    Am
    And now His love has made
                 D7             G
        my heart so glad;
             C               D          G
    He took my sins away.

Chorus:
             D7
    He took my sins away.
            G
    He took my sins away,
                 A                               A7       D – D7
    And keeps me singing ev’ry day!
    G                              C
    I’m so glad He took
                             G
        my sins away.
            C                 D        G
    He took my sins away.

2.    The load of sin was
        more than I could bear;
    He took them all away.
    He took them all away.
    And now on Him I roll
        my ev’ry care,
    He took my sins away.

3.    No condemnation
        have I in my heart;
    He took my sins away.
    He took my sins away.
    His perfect peace He did
        to me impart;
    He took my sins away.

4.    If you will come to
        Jesus Christ today,
    He’ll take your sins away.
    He’ll take your sins away,
    And keep you happy in
        His love each day.
    He’ll take your sins away.
