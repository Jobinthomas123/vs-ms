            G                              G7
1.    I heard an old, old story,
                      C                                   G
    How a Savior came from glory,
                                                          Em
    How He gave His life on Calvary
             A7                                 D
    To save a wretch like me.
          G                               G7
    I heard about His groaning,
                        C                              G
    Of His precious blood’s atoning.
                                     Em
    Then I repented of my sins
               Am            D      G
    And won the victory.

Chorus:
          G
    O victory in Jesus,
               C               G
    My Savior, forever;
                                            Em
    He sought me and bought me
                  A                             D
    With His redeeming blood.
            G
    He loved me ere I knew Him,
               C                           G
    And all my love is due Him.
                                            Em
    He plunged me to victory
            Am                D7              G
    Beneath the cleansing flood.

2.    I heard about His healing,
    Of His cleansing pow’r revealing,
    How He made the lame
        to walk again,
    And caused the blind to see.
    And, then I cried, “Dear Jesus,
    Come and heal my broken spirit,”
    And somehow Jesus came
        and brought
    To me the victory.

3.    I heard about that city
    He is building there in glory,
    And I heard about
        those pearly gates
    Beyond the crystal sea.
    I know that He’s returning—
    Oh, what a blessed hour!
    For on that day I’ll sing up there
    The song of victory.
