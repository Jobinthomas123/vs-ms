      G
1. I love to tell the story
       C             G
   Of unseen things above,
       D              G
   Of Jesus and His glory,
            A7       D
   Of Jesus and His love.
     D7                C G
   I love to tell the story,
     Em                B7
   Because I know ‘tis true.
       C            G
   It satisfies my longings,
       D               G
   As nothing else can do.

Chorus:
      D                 G
   I love to tell the story!
           C                G
   ‘Twill be my theme in glory
                          C
   To tell the old, old story
        G   D        G
   Of Jesus and His love.

2. I love to tell the story;
   More wonderful it seems
   Than all the golden fancies
   Of all our golden dreams.
   I love to tell the story;
   It did so much for me,
   And that is just the reason
   I tell it now to thee.

3. I love to tell the story;
   ‘Tis pleasant to repeat
   What seems each time I tell it,
   More wonderfully sweet.
   I love to tell the story,
   For some have never heard
   The message of salvation
   From God’s own holy Word.

4. I love to tell the story,
   For those who know it best
   Seem hungering and thirsting
   To hear it like the rest.
   And when, in scenes of glory,
   I sing the new, new song,
   ‘Twill be the old, old story,
   That I have loved so long.
