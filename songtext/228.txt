Chorus:
   G
	I am saved, yes, I am saved,
                                    Em         Am  D7
	Hallelujah! Oh, I am saved.
             Am                              D7
	He took my sins that day
                 Am                            D7
	And washed them all away.
               Am               D7        G
	Hallelujah! Oh, I am saved.

                             G
1.	I once was lost in the valley

		of sin’s domain;
                                     Em            Am  D7
	I had no joy or peace within.
               Am                      D7
	Then I heard Jesus call me,
                  Am                           D7
	With arms held out before me;
                                                  G
	I fell repenting of my sins.

2.	It was so dark in the valley;
		I could not see.
	My feet would stumble all the day,
	But Christ the Sun has risen,
	New life to me has given;
	Now happily I’m on my way.

3.	Now I’m a child of my Father
		in heav’n above
	Through faith in Jesus Christ
		the Son.
	I’ve gone into the water;
	My faith is so much broader.
	Through Calvary it’s all been
		done.

4.	And, I’ve gone up to the mountain;
		the fire came down,
	The Holy Spirit dwells within.
	His fire burns within me;
	With new tongues I am singing
	Of how He set me free from sin.

5.	I’m pressing on through to vict’ry
		in Jesus’ name.
	I’m leaving all this world behind.
	I want to see the fountain
	That flows from Zion’s mountain;
	With Jesus we will rule and shine.
