              G
1.    I’ll never be discouraged
                   C                                 Am
    when dismal clouds surround,
               G                        Em         Am D7
    And life is full of toil and pain.
              G
    He Who hath let the clouds
                    C                           Am
        shed forth His rays around;
               G                                       D7  G
    He makes the bitter sweet to me.

Chorus:
             G                     C
    He careth! He beareth!
                 G                      Em
    I’m graven in the palms
                       Am  D7
        of His hands.
               G                        C         Am
    He watcheth and guideth;
              G                                        D7  G
    He makes the bitter sweet to me.

2.    Though perils haunt my way
        and billows high may roll,
    Yet by His grace I shall prevail.
    For, sheltered ‘neath His wings
        no terrors drown my soul;
    He makes the bitter sweet to me.

3.    My joy, the path of suffering,
        my life I count not dear.
    With patience I the race shall run.
    Some stumble and fall back,
        but I to Him draw near;
    He makes the bitter sweet to me.

4.    Infallible His promise—
        by faith I overcome,
    Now bound to Him
        by love’s strong cord.
    Saints grown to Him in fullness,
        one fold in Him become;
    He makes the bitter sweet to me.

5.    When Christ Who is our life
        in glory shall appear,
    His faithful servants He’ll reward.
    And, then no pain nor sorrow,
    His love wipes every tear;
    He makes the bitter sweet to me.
