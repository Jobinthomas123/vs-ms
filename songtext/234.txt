    G                 C         D    G
1.    I have a song that Jesus

        gave me;
                    D7                                G
    It was sent from heav’n above.
                                  C
    There never was
       D        G         Em
        a sweeter melody;
                    A7               D
    ‘Tis a melody of love.

Chorus:
    D7                               G
    In my heart there rings

        a melody.
                   D7
    There rings a melody
                   G
        with heaven’s harmony.
    D7                                G
    In my heart there rings

        a melody;
                   D7                                G
    There rings a melody of love.

2.    I love the Christ Who died
        on Calv’ry,
    For He washed my sins away;
    He put within my heart a melody,
    And I know it’s there to stay.

3.    ’Twill be my endless theme
        in glory;
    With the angels I will sing.
    ’Twill be a song
        with glorious harmony
    When the courts of heaven ring.
