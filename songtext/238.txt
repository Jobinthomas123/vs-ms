1.    As I journey thro’ the land

        singing as I go,

    Pointing souls to Calvary
       A7                            D
        to the crimson flow
        G
    Many arrows pierce my soul
          C                               G
        from without, within,
                                 Em
    But my Lord leads me on;
             G           D7            G
        thro’ Him I must win.

Chorus:
    G
    Oh, I want to see Him,
       C                            G
        look upon His face,

    There to sing forever
       A7                           D
        of His saving grace.
    G
    On the streets of glory
        C                            G
        let me lift my voice—
                                    Em
    Cares all past, home at last,
       G      D7        G
        ever to rejoice.

2.    When in service for my Lord
        dark may be the night,
    But I’ll cling more close to Him;
        He will give the light.
    Satan’s snares may vex my soul,
        turn my thoughts aside,
    But my Lord goes ahead,
        leads whate’er betide.

3.    When in valleys low, I look
        tow’rd the mountain height,
    And behold my Savior there
        leading in the fight.
    With a tender hand outstretched
        tow’rd the valley low,
    Guiding me, I can see,
        as I onward go.

4.    When before me billows rise
        from the mighty deep,
    Then my Lord directs my bark;
        He doth safely keep.
   And He leads me gently on
        thro’ this world below;
    He’s a real Friend to me,
    Oh, I love Him so!
