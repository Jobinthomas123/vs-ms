2.	Elders, martyrs,

	What angels longed to see,
		now man has found.

	God and man at table
		are sat down. x2

3.	Who is this that spreads
		the victory feast?
	Who is this that makes
		our warring cease?
	Jesus, risen Savior,
		Prince of peace—

	God and man at table
		are sat down. x2

4.	Worship in the presence
		of the Lord
	With joyful songs
		and hearts of one accord,
	And let our Host
		at table be adored.

	God and man at table
		are sat down. x2

5.	When at last the earth
		shall pass away,
	When Jesus and His bride
		are one to stay—
	The feast of love
		has just begun that day.

	God and man at table
		are sat down. x2
