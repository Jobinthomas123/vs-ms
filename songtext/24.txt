    D
    By the anointing
         A7                             D
        Jesus breaks the yoke,

    By the Holy Ghost and power
       E7                                        A
        just as the prophets spoke.
          D
    These are the days
                      G
        of the Latter Rain,
       A7                               D
    God is moving in power again,
                          G
    And the anointing
                    D     A7     D
        will break the yoke.
