|D|
By the anointing
   |A|*7*               |D|
  Jesus breaks the yoke,

By the Holy Ghost and power
  |E|*7*                     |A|
  just as the prophets spoke.
  |D|
These are the days
          |G|
  of the Latter Rain,
 |A|*7*               |D|
God is moving in power again,
          |G|
And the anointing
         |D|   |A|*7*   |D|
  will break the yoke.
