1.    Songs of Zion
                                           D7
        from the distant shore,
                          C                               G
    They are pealing, sweetly pealing.

    Zion’s sons are firstfruits
                      D
        unto God—
                       A7                            D
    In their mouth no murmuring.
                          G                                D7
    They are virgins, holy, undefiled,
                            C
    See them standing—
                              G
        great high calling.

    In their trials
                                           Am
        they were sore oppressed
                            D
    But were dauntless
                                    G
        through His grace.

Chorus:
                            G                D
    From the heights of Zion
                  G
        they reign;
                                                         C - Am
    All their loss is turned to gain.
                             D
    They shall see His face,

        they bear His name,
                                          G
    And sing a song unique.
                                     D           G
    What a meeting over there,
                                                    C
    Oh, the glory they do share,
                          Am7                         G
    And with Jesus they shall stand
                Em  G–D    G
        on Zion evermore.

2.    Heights of Zion
        is the pilgrim’s goal;
    They are shining, brightly shining.
    Voices there like
        many waters sound—
    Breaking forth like thundering.
    They are servants
        wholly sanctified—
    In their counsel, God directing.
    They shall ever and forever reign;
    This is Zion’s heritage.

3.    Holy Zion is the Father’s choice.
    God is planning, greatly planning:
    City crystal,
        richly garnished there,
    Perfect rest and harmony.
    Where the saints
        are truly magnified,
    Harps there strung
        show love pervading;
    In that land where love
        forever reigns,
    All in perfect symphony.
