    The Lord is come;

    Let earth receive her King.

    Let ev’ry heart prepare Him room,

    And heav’n and nature sing,

2.    Joy to the world!
    The Savior reigns;
    Let men their songs employ.
    While fields and floods,
        rocks, hills and plains
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

3.    No more let sins
        and sorrows grow,
    Nor thorns infest the ground.
    He comes to make
        His blessings flow
    Far as the curse is found,
    Far as the curse is found,
    Far as, far as the curse is found.

4.    He rules the world
        with truth and grace
    And makes the nations prove
    The glories of His righteousness,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders, wonders
        of His love.
