1.    The first Noel the angels did say
                     F                          C
    Was to certain poor shepherds
       G   C                  F     C
        in fields as they lay;
    G   C                         Em
    In fields where they lay
         F                            C
        keeping their sheep,
                 F                         C
    On a cold winter’s night
           G     C     F    C
        that was so deep.

Chorus:
        C           Em        F         C - G
    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
       C      Em    F  C      G   C–F-C
    Born is the King of Israel.

2.    And by the light of that same star
    Three wise men came from
        country afar.
    To seek for a King
        was their intent,
    And to follow the star
        wherever it went.

3.    This star drew nigh
        to the northwest;
    O’er Bethlehem it took its rest.
    And, there it did both stop and stay,
    Right over the place
        where Jesus lay.

4.    Then entered in,
        those wise men three—
    Fell rev’rently upon their knee.
    And, offered there in His presence
    Their gold and myrrh
        and frankincense.
