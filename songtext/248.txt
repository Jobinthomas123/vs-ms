          C
1.	Thou did’st leave Thy throne and
                          G    C
		Thy kingly crown
                                F               C
	When Thou camest to earth
		           G
		for me,
                    C
	But in Bethlehem’s home
                                          G     C
		there was found no room
        F             C                G - C
	For Thy holy nativity.

Chorus:
          C                       Gm7      C7     F
	O come to my heart, Lord Jesus;
                        C
	There is room in my heart
                    G
		for Thee!
           C                      Gm7
	O come to my heart,
         C7      F            C
		Lord Jesus, come—
         C
	There is room in my heart
         G     C
		for Thee!

2.	Heaven’s arches rang
		when the angels sang,
	Proclaiming Thy royal decree.
	But, in lowly birth
		did’st Thou come to earth
	And in great humility.

3.	The foxes found rest
		and the birds their nest
	In the shade of the forest tree,
	But Thy couch was the sod,
		O Thou Son of God,
	In the deserts of Galilee.

4.	Thou camest, O Lord,
		with the living Word
	That should set Thy people free,
	But with mocking scorn
		and with crown of thorn,
	They bore Thee to Calvary.

5.	When all heaven doth ring
		and her choir shall sing
	At Thy coming to victory,
	Let Thy voice call me home,
		saying, “Yet there is room –
	There is room at My side
		for thee!”

(Ending)
                         C                    Gm7
	And, my heart shall rejoice,
          C7      F
		Lord Jesus,
                                C
	When Thou comest and callest
                G
		for me.
                          C                   Gm7
	Yes, my heart shall rejoice,
         C7       F              C
		Lord Jesus, when—
            C                                             G
	When Thou comest and callest
                 C
		for me.
