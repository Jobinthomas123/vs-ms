    A star of most radiant light.

        but they followed it not;
    To them it would come
        and would pass.

        with all of their heart
    That the star’d find
        the Baby at last.

3.    So often I travelled
        in darkness of night
    With no one to show me the way,
    But one day the Lord
        let His light shine on me
    Now I’m walking
        in His love every day.

    And when I saw the light,
    I rejoiced with great joy.
    And when I saw the light,
    I rejoiced with great joy.
    And when I saw the light,
    I rejoiced with great joy.
    I rejoiced with exceeding
        great joy.
