           G            C             G
1.	It came upon the midnight clear,
                   C            A7          D
	That glorious song of old,
                 G             C              G
	From angels bending near

		the earth
             C                    D              G
	To touch their harps of gold.
                    B7
	“Peace on the earth,
                   Em
		goodwill to men,
                    A                       A7            D
	From heaven’s all gracious King.”
                 G              C             G
	The world in solemn stillness lay
             C             D            G
	To hear the angels sing.

2.	Still thro’ the cloven skies
		they come,
	With peaceful wings unfurled,
	And still their heavenly
		music floats
	O’er all the weary world.
	Above its sad and lowly plains,
	They bend on hovering wing.
	And ever o’er its Babel sounds
	The blessed angels sing.

3.	And ye, beneath life’s
		crushing load,
	Whose forms are bending low,
	Who toil along the climbing way
	With painful steps and slow,
	Look now for glad and
		golden hours
	Come swiftly on the wing.
	O rest beside the weary road,
	And hear the angels sing.

4.	For lo, the days are hastening on,
	By prophet bards foretold.
	When with the ever circling years
	Comes round the age of gold;
	When peace shall over all the earth
	It’s ancient splendors fling,
	And the whole world give back
		the song
	Which now the angels sing.
