       A                                 D        Bm
1.    Long time ago in Bethlehem,
                      E                   A
    So the Holy Bible says,
                                              D            Bm
    Mary’s Boy Child, Jesus Christ,
                 E                                    A
    Was born on Christmas Day.
                      A
    While shepherds watched
                     D              Bm
        their flocks by night,
                                E
    They saw a bright new
                           A
        shining star

    And heard a choir from
          D           Bm
        heaven sing;
                  E                              A
    The music came from afar.

Chorus:
       A                    D            E            C#7
    Hark! Now hear the angels sing—
      F#m                    B            E
    New King is born today
                  A                           D      Bm
    And man can live forevermore
           E                                       A
    Because of Christmas Day.

2.    Now Joseph and his wife Mary
    Came to Bethlehem that night.
    They found no place
        to bear her Child—
    Not a single place in sight.
    Well, by and by they found a nook
    In a stable all forlorn,
    And in a manger cold and dark,
    Mary’s little Boy Child was born.

3.    How silently, how silently,
    The wondrous gift is giv’n!
    So God imparts to human hearts
    The blessings of His heav’n.
    No ear may hear His coming,
    But in this world of sin,
    Where meek souls will
        receive Him still,
    The dear Christ enters in.

4.    O holy Child of Bethlehem,
    Descend on us, we pray;
    Cast out our sin, and enter in,
    Be born in us today.
    We hear the Christmas angels
    The great glad tidings tell;
    O come to us, abide with us,
    Our Lord Emmanuel!
