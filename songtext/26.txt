You can’t stop me
      |F|         |C|
From loving my Lord;
               |A|*m*
No power can change
    |D|*7*           |G|*7*
My faith in His Word.
            |C|
Though you take all my gain,
         |F|            |C|
I’ll not fret nor complain;
                   |A|*m*
No, you can’t stop me
      |G|         |C|
From loving my Lord.
