2.    Willing to die for your sins
        and your shame,
    I laid aside all
        My glory and fame
    That you may be saved
        in My precious name,
    Who will now follow
        to serve Me today?

3.    If you’ll forsake all
        your ambition vain,
    Crowning Me King
        in Your own life to reign,
    All that is Mine will be your heav’nly gain.
    Who will now follow
        to serve Me today?

4.  All throne, dominion
        and power are Mine;
    Father hath placed Me
        on Zion to reign.
    My servants true
        will with Me rule and shine.
    Who will now follow
        to serve Me today?


5.    Yes, where I am,
        there My servants shall be—
    Perfectly one
        with Us, the Trinity;
    They shall have access
        to God’s mystery.
    Who will now follow
        to serve Me today?
