               E                                 A       F#m7
1.    My Jesus, may Thy love alone,
                   E         C#m        F#m7-B
    Guide me in pilgrim way.

               E              E7
    Let earthly charms
               A            F#m7
        fore’er be gone;
                 E            B7       E
    Be Thou my only stay. x2

2.    Lord, purify my heart and mind.
    That work of grace in me

    Teach me from day
        to day to find,
    Thy matchless love so free. x2

3.    Thy faithful Word gives
        life and light
    When Satan’s darts assail.

    Give me the needed
        inward might—
    The joy that will prevail. x2

4.    A lasting hope of Zion above—
    My vision make Thou clear.

    O Holy Spirit, gentle Dove,
    Lead Thou me safely there. x2

5.    Beneath Thy wings, do shelter me—
    My hiding place there sure.

    When night be gone,
        the day I see;
    My anchor is secure. x2

6.    A crown of life awaits me there,
    If faithful I shall be.

    And, those who bear
        the cross will share
    Thy throne eternally. x2
