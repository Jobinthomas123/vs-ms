1.    When morning breaks

        and shadows flee away,
      F                 C             G7
    Jesus the King of glory
                        C
        shall appear.
                               G               F              C
    Then we’ll meet Him on that Day;
           F                         G
    Rejoice, for His coming
                          C
        draweth near!

Chorus:
         C                           F
    Shouting “Hallelujah” when
               C                                G
        we hear the trumpet sound,
                                   G7                    C-F-C
    Singing “Hallelujah” in the sky!
                                             F
    Greeting Him with joy,
                     C                         G
    Singing as we gather round;
          F                           G
    Changed in the twinkling
                     C
        of an eye.

2.    Though Satan casts
        his fiery darts around,
    Slaying some saints
        who once for truth did fight;
    Courage, let your faith abound!
    Strong in the power of His might.

3.    When Satan’s vanquished
        and the victory’s won,
    Christ will reward
        His servants one by one.
    Oh, how sweet His words:
        “Well done”—
    Victors the race they have run!

4.    Stand firm, ye saints,
        with armor shining bright;
    Press on to victory
        for the right and pure.
    Great is Christ
        our Captain’s might,
    Through Him the victory is sure.

5.    Count it all joy
        to suffer for His name—
    Cast out, defamed,
        reproached on every side;
    He will give you His new name,
    And you will reign as His bride.
