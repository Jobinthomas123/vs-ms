Chorus:
                          D
    Yes, I’m gonna overcome
                 C
        and sit upon His throne;
                    G
    Gonna sing His praises
                        D
        through all eternity.

    Yes, I’m gonna overcome
                 C
        and sit upon His throne;
                        G
    Gonna shout “Hallelujah”
                      D
        to the King of kings.

1.    And, just beyond the crystal sea
        of glass I saw a throne,
    And the Ancient of Days
        was seated there.
    And, in His eyes the fire flashed—
        the fire of His love,
    And the radiance of heaven
    Sparkled ‘round about His head.

2.    And, as we danced the four and
        twenty elders joined right in,
    And the beasts gave glory
        to the King.
    The elders cast
        their golden crowns
    Before His mighty throne;
    They cried, “Glory!
        You have made all things.”
    They cried, “Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty,
    Which was and is and is to come.
    Let us be glad, rejoice,
        and give honor unto Him
    For the marriage of the Lamb
        is come!”
