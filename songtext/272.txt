     Am                               C
1.    The Lord said to My Lord,
        G                           D2
    “Sit at My right hand
          Am                           C
    Until I make Thine enemies
              G                               E
        a footstool for Thy feet.”
                      Am
    Oh, the Lord shall send
                  C
        His rod of strength
                G                     D2

Chorus:
        Am     C                     G

        of thine enemies.” x2

2.    And, so it was foretold
        about the coming King,
    Who triumphs over sin and death
    And rules o’er everything.
    From His mighty throne in Zion,
    In that city made by God,
        He says,

3.    Remember the disciples
        back in Jerusalem;
    They waited in an upper room
    Where the Lord did baptize them
    With His Holy Spirit and fire
    So that they could boldly stand.
        He said,

4.    And, just as our Lord Jesus
        could not be overcome,
    To us He gave the power to live
        just like God’s only Son.
    Oh, the gates of hell
        shall not prevail
    Against this church I build,
        for you will:
