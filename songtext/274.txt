    I am covered over with
               Dmaj7
        the robe of righteousness
                           Em           A
    That Jesus gives to me,
          Em          A
        gives to me.
    Em
    I am covered over with
                     A7
        the precious blood of Jesus,
                       D
    And He lives in me, lives in me.

    What a joy it is to know
             Dmaj7                     D7
    My heav’nly Father loves me so
            G                            Em
    He gives to me my Jesus.
           D                           Bm
    When He looks at me,
                               Em                      A
    He sees not what I used to be
                              G—D
    But He sees Jesus.
