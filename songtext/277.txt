                  A                               D
1. Great are the ways of God
                  A
        to know
                E                                  A
    The depths of love for me;
               A
    By death, Thou crushed
                D              A
        the ruthless foe,
                  E                        A
    From sin to set me free.

Chorus:
         A
    Waiting for the Lord
                         D                   Bm
        Who is coming for me,
        A                              F#m                  E
    Precious are my thoughts of Thee.
         A
    Waiting for the Day
                       D                         Bm
        when shadows all do flee,
                    A                E            A
    When will that morning be?
        A
    Waiting for the Day,
        D
    Waiting for the Day,
         E                                              A
    Waiting for the crowning Day;
         A
    Waiting for the Day,
         D
    Waiting for the Day,
        A                            E                 A
    Waiting for the crowning Day.

2.    Thy strength divine
        doth quicken me,
    No more to falter now.
    My soul Thou calmest
        with Thy peace;
    Now at Thy feet I bow.

3.    All day and night
        Thou leadest me;
    Thy tender voice I hear.
    Thy healing waters quicken me;
    No ills can make me fear.

4.    What wealth of heav’n
        is stored for me—
    Joint-heir with Thee to reign.
    Eternal kingdom offered free—
    For me the Lamb was slain.
