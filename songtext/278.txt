1.    Awake, O Israel,
                                  Am
        put off your slumber,
                        Em                              B7
    And the truth shall set you free.
                             Em
    For, out of Zion,
                                     Am
        comes your Deliverer
                   Em         B7   Em
    In the Year of Jubilee.

2.    For, in the furnace
        of much affliction,
    I have chosen thee, behold!
    And for iron, I’ll give you silver,
    And for brass, I’ll give you gold.

3.    Thou art My chosen,
        for I have sought thee.
    Thou art graven in My hands,
    And I will gather
        all those that gather
    And return them to their land.
