    It’s the glory of the Lord;
                     A            F#m
    It’s the love of God.
            B7
    He didn’t have to do it,
                      E      A       E
    But He did it anyway.

    He paid the price
              A                         F#m
    That I could never pay;
              B7                               E
    He took all my sins away.
