1.    Oh, what a wonderful,

        wonderful day—
                                            B7
    Day I will never forget.
      F#m
    After I’d wandered
             B7
        in darkness away,
                                               E
    Jesus, my Savior, I met.

     Oh, what a tender,

        compassionate friend;
      E7                                           A
    He met the need of my heart.

     Shadows dispelling,
                   E
        with joy I am telling,
             B7                                              E
    He made all the darkness depart!

Chorus:
        E                         C#m
    Heaven came down,
                 F#m  B7               E
    And glory filled my soul,
                                 C#m
    When at the cross
              F#m       B7                 E
    My Savior made me whole.
            F#m                             F#m7
    My sins were washed away,
                       E                  G
    And my night was turned
               C#m - Adim
        to day;
        E                        C#m
    Heaven came down,
                F#m   B7                E
    And glory filled my soul.

2.    Born of the Spirit,
        with life from above,
    Into God’s family divine.
    Justified fully through
        Calvary’s love,
    Oh, what a standing is mine.
    And, the transaction
        so quickly was made,
    When as a sinner I came—
    Took of the offer of grace
    He did proffer, He saved me,
    Oh, praise His dear name!

3.    Now I’ve a hope
        that will surely endure
    After the passing of time;
    I have a future in heaven for sure,
    There in those mansions sublime.
    And, it’s because of
        the wonderful day
    When at the cross I believed.
    Riches eternal
        and blessings supernal,
    From His precious hand
        I received.
