Chorus:
               D                Bm
	He arose! He arose!
                G                         A
	Hallelujah! Christ arose!
                        D                                    Bm
	May the Book of Life never close,
                        Em
	Till the whole world knows,
                  A
	The whole world knows,
              D                 Bm

1.	Hist’ry began long ago,
G                                            A
	Many years before man.
	     D                          Bm
	There’s so much we don’t know
G                                                A
	That went into God’s plan.
	                    G
	Why do stars stay in place
		               F#m
		in the heavens?
	                     G             F#m                  G
	Why do atoms behave as they do?
	                      D
	Yet, what God does reveal,
	                   Bm
	No one wants to conceal;
	               Em                               A
	It’s a message great and true.

		Oh! Oh!

2.	Evil prevailed in the world
		so long.
	What was man to do?
	Then a Man named Jesus
		came along
	With words of life and truth.
	For His love they repaid Him
		with hatred;
	For compassion,
	He hung on the cross.
	Well, it looked like the end,
	To the hope God did send;
	Come at last to a tragic loss?
	No! No!

3. No one knows
		when He’s coming again
	Like He said He would.
	He’s just giving us time
		to help mankind
	Receive Him as they should.
	When He comes
		in His beautiful splendor
	And He calls all His own
		to His side,
	I’m so glad I’ll be there.
	There’s no need to despair,
	When in Him you do abide,
		because...
