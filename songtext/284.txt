      Cma7                    Fmaj7
1.    Hear my cry, O God;
       Bb  Cmaj7            Fma7-Bb
    Give heed to my prayer.

Chorus:
                          C                 G/B
    From the end of the earth
                           Am
        I call to Thee;
                                           Bb-G
    When my heart is faint
                                      F
    Lead me to the Rock
                       G                Am
        that is higher than I,
                     F
    To the Rock
                      G               Am
        that is higher than I;
                                     F
    Lead me to the Rock
                     G                 Am
        that is higher than I,
                                                Bb
    For Thou hast been a refuge
               G
      for me.

2.    Let me dwell in Thy tent forever;
    Let me take refuge
        in the shelter of Thy wing.

3.    So, I will sing praise
        to Thy name forever
    That I may pay my vows
        day by day.
