 D                     A7     D
Draw me and I will run after Thee;
          G       D
I cannot come by myself.
                         F#  Bm
Draw me and I will run after Thee;
Em7             A        D
Donâ€™t leave me here by myself.
 G          Em7
There is no real joy
    D       Bm
 apart from Thee;
Em7          A           D
There is no real peace at all.
 G         Em7          D     Bm
Draw me and I will run after Thee;
 Em7           A        D
Lord, hear me now as I call.
 Em7           A        D
Lord, hear me now as I call.
