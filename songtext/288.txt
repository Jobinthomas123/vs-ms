      D
 How lovely is
          G
  Your dwelling place,
D           G
 O Lord my God.
     D               G
 My soul longs and faints
            Em7-A
  for your courts,
     D               G
 And I would rather be,
     D                  G
  a doorkeeper in Your house
           D      G
 Than to live my life
            Em7-A
  somewhere else.

             D
 You are my Sun,
              G
 You are my Shield,
             D               G
 You are my Lover from the start.
           D                A
 And, the highway to Your City
                   G-D
  runs through my heart.
