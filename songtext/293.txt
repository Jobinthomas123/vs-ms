                D                              G
1.	I’ve seen the face of Jesus;
                 A                               D
	He smiled in love on me.
                                                  G    Em
	It filled my heart with rapture—
               A                          D
	My soul with ecstasy.
                                               G
	The scars of deepest anguish
                  A                         D
	Were lost in glory bright.
                                             G  Em
	I’ve seen the face of Jesus,
            A                                D
	It was a wondrous sight.

Chorus:
                 D                              G
	Oh, glorious face of beauty,
               A                             D
	Oh, gentle touch of care—
                                      G   Em
	If here it is so blessed,
                   A                        D
	What will it be up there?

2.	And, since I’ve seen His beauty,
	All else I count but loss.
	The world, its fame and pleasure,
	Is now to me but dross.
	His light dispelled my darkness;
	His smile was, oh, so sweet.
	I’ve seen the face of Jesus;
	I can but kiss His feet.

3.	I’ve heard the voice of Jesus;
	He told me of His love
	And called me His own treasure,
	His undefiled, His dove.
	It came like softest music
	Across an ocean calm;
	And seemed to play so sweetly,
	Some wondrous holy psalm.

4.	I’ve felt the hand of Jesus;
	His touch was, oh, so dear.
	He drew me closer, softly,
	And whispered, “Do not fear”.
	Like clouds before the sunshine,
	My cares have rolled away;
	I’m sitting in His presence,
	It is a brand new day.

5.	I know He’s coming shortly
	To take us all above;
	We’ll sing redemption’s story,
	The story of His love.
	We’ll hear His voice of music;
	We’ll feel His hand of care.
	He’ll never rest—He says so,
	Until He has us there.
