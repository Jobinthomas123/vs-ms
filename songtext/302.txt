            D                 A
    O Lord, our Lord,
               D                                  Bm
    How excellent is Thy name
                             Em  A
    In all of the earth. x2

                             G                F#m
    When I consider the heavens,
                 G                     D
    The work of Thy fingers,
                 E7
    The moon and the stars
                                              A
    Which Thou hast ordained,
                     D                       F#m
    Then I say, “What is man, Lord,
                    G                            D
    That Thou art mindful of him;
                       G          F#m
    And the son of man, Lord,
                    G                                 A
    That Thou shouldst visit him?”

                              D
    (Ending: Amen)
