    Far above all rule
                         F     Dm
        and authority,
                 C                        G7-C
    And power and dominion

                             F
    And every name
                      G
        that is named,
              C                     Am
    Not only in this age
             F                   G             C
    But also in the one to come;

                              G
    Christ is seated
                     C                        Am7
    At the Father’s right hand
         Dm7-G           C
    In heavenly places,
                                                       G
    And we are seated with Him
                    C                        Am7
    At the Father’s right hand
         Dm7-G           C
    In heavenly places!
