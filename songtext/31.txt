                                   G
    Therefore the redeemed

        of the Lord shall return,
                                      C
    And come with singing
                   Am7
        unto Zion,
                       G
    And everlasting joy
                    D7                         G
        shall be upon their heads.

                                C
    They shall obtain
                                    G
        gladness and joy,
               A7
    And sorrow and mourning
                                D
        shall flee away.
