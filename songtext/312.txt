                 D                    G                D
    Give ear to my words, O Lord;
              G D/F#  Em7   D/F#−A
    Consider    my    meditation.
       Em                              Bm
    Hearken unto the voice
                       Em−Em7
        of my cry,
               G-D/F Em   Em7    A
    My King   and  my God.
               Em         Bm                Em−Em7
    For, unto Thee will I pray;
                G          D/F#            Em
    My voice shalt Thou hear
       Em7        A
        in the morning.
             D
    O Lord, in the morning
              G                         D
    Will I direct my prayer
                    G    D/F# Em    A        G−D
    Unto Thee and will look up.
