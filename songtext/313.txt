                      Am
1.    As the mountains are around
             G     C
        Jerusalem,
                Dm
    The Lord is all around
                  Em Am
        His people. x2

Chorus:
                    G              Am
    From this time forth
                      G        Am
        and forevermore,
                       Dm
    Oh, the Lord is all around
                   Em Am
        His people.
                    G              Am
    From this time forth
                    G             Am
        it will always be;
                Dm
    The Lord is all around
                  Em Am
        His people.

2.    Like Mount Zion in the midst
        of Jerusalem,
    We cannot be moved,
    We cannot be moved. x2
