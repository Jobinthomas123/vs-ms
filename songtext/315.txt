Chorus:
        D                  Dma7                      D7
    Surely the presence of the Lord
                             G
        is in this place;
                 Em                            A
    I can feel His mighty power
                            D        Em7
        and His grace.
                  D
    I can hear the brush
                Dma7
        of angels’ wings;
                  D7                       G
    I see glory on each face.
      Em                 A                             G
    Surely the presence of the Lord
            A              D
        is in this place.

                    D                        Bm
1.    In the midst of His children,
                G                                    A
    The Lord said He would be.
                          D                  Bm
    It doesn’t take very many;
                  G                              A
    It can be just two or three,
                   F#
    And I feel that same
                         Bm
        sweet Spirit
                          A                            D
    That I’ve felt oft times before;
       E7                    E
    Surely I can say —
               Em                        A
    I’ve been with the Lord.

2.    There’s a holy hush around us,
    As God’s glory fills this place.
    I’ve touched the hem
        of His garment;
    I can almost see His face!
    And, my heart is overflowing
    With the fullness of His joy.
    I know without a doubt
    That I have been with the Lord.
