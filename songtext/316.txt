             D                       G     D-A
1.	O Lord, You’re beautiful.
                   D         G   D   A
	Your face is all I seek,
                  Bm               F#
	For when Your eyes
                Bm  A       D
		are on this child,
                    G     D    A                G - D
	Your grace abounds to me.

Chorus:
    D                G         D/F#   Em
	I wanna take Your Word
         D       A                    D
		and shine it all around,
                                         G
	But first help me just
              E7          A
		to live it, Lord.
                                      G−D/F#  Em
	And, when I’m doing   well
                 D          A                          F#
	Help me to never seek a crown,
                           Bm         A
	For my reward is giving
         G−A          D
		glory to You.

2.	O Lord, please light the fire
	That once burned bright and clear.
	Replace the lamp of my first love
	That burns with holy fear.
