        E               B                            A  E
1.    Do you know that I love Jesus?
                         A                                E
    Do you know that I serve Him?
                                                         C#m7
    All because He loved me first
                                   F# − B7
        and died for me
                           A                      B
    And His glory deep in my heart
                  A                     E
        will never grow dim,
                        B                    B7
    While I sing of His love
                          E
        full and free.

Chorus:
                  E                  C#m7
    He is altogether lovely—
             F#m7             B7
        of Him will I sing.
                       F#m7                 B7
    He’s the Lover of my soul
                          E−B7
        and my King.
                  E                                 E7
    I will serve Him all my days
                A                     F#m7
    And run my holy race,
                  E                          F#m7
    Till I see my loving Lord
         B7          E
        face to face!

2.    I was lost a shameful sinner—
    Held by passions of the world,
    Void of joy, eternal life,
        and peace within.
    But, He came in search of me,
        what a love pure as gold,
    And redeemed me from
        bondage of sin!

3.    Yes, He cleansed my life so filthy
    With His holy spotless blood,
    And He clothed me with His
        robe of righteousness.
    What a joy to walk with Him
        and live by His pure Word
    And to share His grace
        and holiness!

4.    Do you know that I am baptized—
    Buried in the water deep?
    Thus, I’m dead to sin
        and all its nature wild.
    Quickened by the Holy Spirit,
        Who doth now me keep;
    Oh, how sweet is He—
        tender and mild!

5.    Far above the highest heaven,
    Crowned with glory
        He doth reign.
    In His name shall both
        the great and small adore.
    He has conquered every foe,
        for He died not in vain;
    And He shall endure forevermore.

6.    And He whispers, “I am coming
    For My bride; yes, she is Mine.”
    Are you saved, are you baptized
        and cleansed from sin?
    Are you filled and are you led
        by His Spirit Divine?
    Can you say, “Oh my God,
        I am Thine?”
