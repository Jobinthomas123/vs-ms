      A
	Thou hast turned my mourning

		into dancing for me;
	                                                        E7
	Thou hast put off my sackcloth.

	Thou hast turned my mourning

		into dancing for me
	                                             D    A
	And girded me with gladness.

	To the end that my glory

		may sing praise to Thee
	                         D
	And not be silent;
	       Bm               A
	O Lord, my God, I will give
	       E                                   D-A
		thanks unto Thee forever.
