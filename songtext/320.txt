1.There are faces dear
   D/A
that I hold in mem’ry,
A B7E
Tho’ I lost them long ago;
   A
But the face of One
 D/A
altogether lovely,
  A   E A
Is the fairest of all I know.

Chorus:
   DAE  A
His face will outshine them all.
  D   Bm   A
His face will outshine them all.
   A-E-A
Glory to the Lamb, Hallelujah!
   D  A  E  A
His face will outshine them all.

2.There were voices sweet
over Bethl’hem singing
When the Savior Christ was born.
And, the golden harps of the angels ringing
Broke the tidings that holy morn.

3.There are friendly hands
unto me extended
When I seem to miss my way,
But His pierced hand,
till the march is ended,
Leadeth up to the realms of day.

4.There are worldly things
that attract the eye—
Beauty sights o’er land and sea.
But, when Jesus comes
in the clouds of heaven,
Oh, what glory will dawn for me!
