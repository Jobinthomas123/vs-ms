Chorus:
        C                                      D
    Come back quickly, Lord!
                     G                             Em
    We’re waiting day and night—
       G                             Em
    Loving Your appearing
                   A7                        D

    To sit with You on high;
         G                                   Am7
    Come back quickly, Lord,
        D                   G

2.    We’re pilgrims, strangers
        on this earth—
    No place to lay our head.
    But, faces pointed to the Lamb,
        and by His Spirit led;
    Holding fast our confidence,
        inheritance divine;
    Still running, although
        others may resign.

3.    His hinds’ feet He has given us
        upon the mountain hills—
    Filling us with rapturous joy,
        as valleys He now fills.
    Maranatha is our prayer—
        our blessed hope’s reward.
    Make haste, oh tarry not,
        beloved Lord!

4.    Although the way seem
        steep and high
    That leads to blessed end—
    Travelling through paths untrod,
        oft times without a friend.
    His love is burning in our hearts,
        and draws us day by day;
    His rod and staff do keep us
        in the way!

5.    Our living hope grows brighter
    As we reach that perfect day.
    Our body will be raptured from
        the grasp of death’s decay.
    Exceeding joy will catch us up
        to glorious throne above
    Where we shall see Him
        face to face in love.
