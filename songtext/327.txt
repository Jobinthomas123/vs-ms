                  C
1.    Oh, I dearly love to ponder
                             F                        C
        when the sun is sinking low,

    And I’m pressing on my journey
                                    D7         G
        through this world below—
                  C
    Of a blessed time that’s coming
                           F
    When my feet no more
                    C
        shall roam.
                         D7
    Here the way is often thorny,
                       G       D7       G7
        but the road leads home.

Chorus:
                  C
    It’s a narrow way.
                 F            Dm7
    It’s a narrow way.
              F                                   C
    It is often rough and thorny,
                          D7                  G
        but this way leads home.
                          C
    And, my Savior’s gone

        before me;
                    F
    He has given His Word
                          C
        to cheer me;
                                                  Am7
    Yes, a narrow way to glory,
                        Dm7   G         C
        but this way leads home.

2.    When I climb up hills of trial,
    When the tempest wild
        doth sweep,
    And descend affliction’s valley
        with its shadows deep;
    I can hear Him sweetly saying,
        “All this weary path I’ve gone.
    Yes, I know the way is thorny,
        but the road leads home.”

3.    When my friends forsake
        and leave me,
    In the world I’m left alone,
    What a bliss to know
        He’s with me,
    All to Him I owe;
    And the shame, despising ever,
    I’ll the race with patience run;
    For I’ll look to Him the Author
        till the prize be won.

4.    So, I’ll bear the cross for Jesus
        for His love constraineth me.
    I will follow in His footsteps
        till His face I see.
    In my Father’s house of mansions,
    I shall never sigh nor moan;
    So I sing along the journey
        for the road leads home.
