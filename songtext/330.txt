                        G                C
1.	Now, Christ, in Thee
                G                 Em
		my soul finds rest
                  G                 D           G
	When all seems lost to me.
                            C               G      Em
	I feared to face the fiery test
                  G                  A7                  D
	And sought the world not Thee.

Chorus:
        G
	Life eternal is in Jesus;
      C                 G                                   D
	All my springs are now in Thee.
         G                                               C − Am
	There my endless striving ceases
                 G                   D-G
	As I look to Calvary.
                                             C    G
	Love that speaks silently—
                           D                       G
	One that brings me liberty.

	How Thy life Thou reckoned not
               C             G
		for saving me,
                                   D     G
	What a Savior is He!

2.	When sick and suffering
		unto death,
	I cried in agony,
	Acquainted with my pains,
		Christ saith,
	“I bore the stripes for thee.”

3.	“Behold, I send the Comforter,”
	Thy parting words they be.
	When He abides there’s nought
		to fear—
	The Father’s gift to me.

4.	The veil is rent, my anchor’s cast
	 In realms of glory great;
	And when my race is run at last,
	A fellow-heir my state.

5.	My yearning soul doth pine
		for Thee.
	Do hasten, Lord, Thy Day.
	And, when my eyes Thy glory see,
	Great God what shall I say?
