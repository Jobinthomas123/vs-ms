                E                                     A
1.    Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
         B
    Thou that leadest Joseph
        E
        like a flock.

       Thou that dwellest
                  A                         F#m
        between the cherubim—
             E          B         E
    O Lord, shine forth!

2.    Stir up Thy strength, O Lord,
    And come right now;
    Come and save us!
    Turn us again—
    Cause Thy face to shine,
    And we shall be saved!
