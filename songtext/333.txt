                    D              − G
    I will serve Thee
                          D
    Because I love Thee;
                           A                       D
    You have given life to me.
                               − G
    I was nothing
                                D
        before You found me;
                           A                       D
    You have given life to me.
         G              Em7             D      − Bm
    Heartaches, broken pieces,
                    A                  A7
    Ruined lives are why You
       D    Em   Fdim   D/F#
    Died on Calvary.
        G                Em7
    Your touch was what
           D                − Bm
        I longed for;
                          Em7   A          D
    You have given life to me.
