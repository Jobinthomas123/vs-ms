    C               G/B               Am
1.	Only in God is my soul
                      Am/G
		now at rest;
             F                    G           C
	In Him comes my salvation.
                          G/B              Am
	Only the Lord is my refuge
                   Am/G
		and rock,
                    F                  G           C
	My strength and my salvation.

Chorus:
                  F                             Am
	My stronghold, my Savior,
    F             G            Am
	I shall not be afraid at all;
                  F                            Am
	My stronghold, my Savior,
    F             G               C
	I shall not be moved.

2.	Only in God is found safety
		and peace
	When I’m pursued by the enemy.
	Only in God is found glory
		and grace
	When I’m found meek
		and found lowly.
