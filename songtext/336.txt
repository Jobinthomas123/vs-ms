    Come let us go up
                     Dm                          G
    To the mountain of the Lord—
       Dm        G                        C
    To the house of our God. x2

                 F               G
    And, He will teach us
                        C  — Am
        of His ways,
               F               G                      F—C
    And we will walk in His paths.
               F            G                 C
    For, out of Zion shall go forth
                Am
        the law
                         Dm                  G
    And the Word of the Lord
                               C
        from Jerusalem.
