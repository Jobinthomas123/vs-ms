Chorus:
    D            Em   A              D      Bm
	In His time, in His time,
                         Em                           A7
	He makes all things beautiful
		              D     D7
		in His time.

1.	Lord, please show me every day,
                            F#m                             Bm
	As You’re teaching me Your way,
                        Em                               A
	That You do just what You say
                        D
		in Your time.

2.	Lord, my life to You I bring;
	You make new of everything;
	Like the blossom of the spring,
		in Your time.

3.	Lord, I bring to You each tear;
	In my saddest times You’re near.
	When I cry I know You’ll hear
		in Your time.

4.	Lord, please take me by the hand;
	Help me always understand
	That in my life You have a plan
		in Your time.

	(End on verse)
