  GEm
1.The most beautiful song
   C   D
Is the one from Song of songs—
GEm
The King’s great message of love,
 C D
Far greater than Solomon’s.

Chorus:
 GEm
For, He planted in my heart
   CD
The seed of His great love
  GEm
That will lead me to perfection,
 CD   G
As the sun when fully shone.

2. Draw me nigh to You;
You’re the choice of my heart.
We’ll run together with gladness,
For we are united in love.

3.Don’t look to me with shame,
For I am dark and stained.
But, a King from afar came;
He found me and loved me the same.
