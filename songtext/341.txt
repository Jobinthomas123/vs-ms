      G                                    Em
1.	The most beautiful song
                   C                                   D
	Is the one from Song of songs—
                G                                            Em
	The King’s great message of love,
                 C                             D
	Far greater than Solomon’s.

Chorus:
                         G                        Em
	For, He planted in my heart
               C                                D
	The seed of His great love
                          G                        Em
	That will lead me to perfection,
     C                                D           G
	As the sun when fully shone.

2. Draw me nigh to You;
	You’re the choice of my heart.
	We’ll run together with gladness,
	For we are united in love.

3.	Don’t look to me with shame,
	For I am dark and stained.
	But, a King from afar came;
	He found me and loved me the same.
