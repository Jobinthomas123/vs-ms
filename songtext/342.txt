1.Jesus said, “If you want
F#m
 to follow Me,
DA
Deny yourself—
 E
take up your cross.
D   E
You must be willing
  A F#m
to lay your own life down—
 A  —E
All your earthly gain
   A – D - A
to count as loss.”

Chorus:
   A7D
I’ll follow You, Lord,
  A
wherever You go;
   B7
I’ll love You, Lord,
  E
with my heart and my soul!
D
Whatever the price may be,
   A —- F#m
I’m willing to pay;
 A
I’ll serve You, Lord,
E  A
each and every day!

2.Jesus said, “All the foxes have
their holes;
Birds of the air,
they have their nests.
But, those who’ve chosen
to follow in My steps,
They may never find
a place to rest.”

3.Jesus said, “Do you love Me
more than these—
More than your friends
and family?
Unless you love Me far more
than those held dear,
You can never be
found worthy of Me.”

4.Jesus said, “Now you must
forsake your all,
Sell all you have, give to the poor.
Where is your treasure?
Your heart shall be there, too;
Let the riches of
My kingdom be yours.”

5.Jesus said, “If you serve Me
faithfully,
Where I am going you shall be;
The very glory
My Father’s given Me
We shall share for all eternity.”
