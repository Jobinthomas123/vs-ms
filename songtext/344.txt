Chorus:
            D                       —Em
	A Song of songs,
                          F#m               G    —Em
	A song of joy to my heart,

	A song of hope,
                           F#m                G     —Em
	A song of faith to my Love,
                               A7                        D
	A song of rejoicing to my King.

                     Em                 F#m    G
1.	Draw me and let us run alone;
Em                                   A
	Bring me to the chambers
                         D
		of Your love.
G                    A                              F#m
	I will remember all Your love
                                Bm
		more than wine.
Em                                             A
	Let Him kiss with the kisses
                      D   —-D7
		of His love.
G                                     A
	Behold, You are fair my Love
                   F#m                      Bm
		and pleasant to my eyes,
Em               A                                        D
	I will rejoice and be glad in You.

2.	Listen, the voice of my Love
		from the hills,
	With joy He is coming forth
		to me.
	He said, “Arise My love
		and come away with Me,
	O My dove, My undefiled,
		My love.
	The time of the singing of the
		birds has come to us;
	Arise My love and come away
		with Me.”

3.	My Love has gone to His
		garden of love;
	A garden enclosed is where
		He feeds.
	Set me as a seal upon
		Your heart forevermore;
	Many waters can never quench
		our love.
	I am Your beloved and I know
		that You are mine.
	Let me dwell forever in Your love.
