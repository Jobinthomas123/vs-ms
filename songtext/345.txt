         C               Am      F
1.    Was it for nought that I died
                G
        on Calvary?
              C                      Am
    My love gave I thee
              Dm7                   G
        to transform thy life;
    C                Am                    F
    I have a purpose for thee.
                            G                         C — C7
        Wilt thou yield now to Me?

Chorus:
F                               G
    However shall I say “No”
             Cma7              Am
        to such a great love?
F                                     G
    A love that constraineth me
            Cma7             Am
        to say, “Yes, Lord!”
F                             G
    O Lord, I surrender
                           Cma7            Am
        my whole life unto Thee;
Dm7                         G                             C
    A prisoner of love shall I ever be.

2.    In times of myrrh,
        a comfort I’ll be to thee.
    Both sweet times and trials
        will sanctify thee;
    I’ll be with thee through it all.
        Wilt thou answer My call?

3.    Though times be dark, soon joy
        will break forth as light.
    I’ll gather thee home
        to reign as My bride.
    Come sit with Me on My throne.
    Wilt thou now be Mine own?
