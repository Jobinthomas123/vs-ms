1.	I am nothing;
                     D                          Bm
		I was born from the dust,
D                                    Bm
	But I know You love me
                          E7                     A
		for You died on the cross.
D                              Bm
	Before Your presence,
                      D                            Bm
		what more could I exclaim?
                   D  -Bm           Em  -A
	I am Yours, I am Yours.

Chorus:
                           D                       Bm
	Take my hands, Lord, I ask You;
                       Em                    A7
	Take my lips, Lord, I love You.
                           F#m                  Bm7

                            F#m                 Bm7
	Take my whole life, O Father,
                 Em – A             D
	I am Yours, I am Yours.

2.	When I am kneeling,
		Jesus, I look unto You.
	I can see Your greatness
		but my smallness too.
	What can I give You, Lord?
	Only myself—
	I am Yours, I am Yours.
