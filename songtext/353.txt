      A              D/A
1.    Do you hear them coming,
            A
        brother,
          D/A                                   A
    Climbing up to Zion’s height
                                                        E     D
    Clad in glorious shining garments,
         E7
    Blood-washed garments
                                A
        pure and white?

Chorus:
                    A
    ‘Tis a glorious church
                 D                        A
        without spot or wrinkle—
                                     F#m
    Washed in the blood
                         E       E7
        of the Lamb.
                    A
    ‘Tis a glorious church
                 D                         A
        without spot or wrinkle—
                                       F#m  E             A
    Adorned as the bride of the Lamb.

2.    Do you hear the stirring anthems,
    Filling all the earth and sky?
    ‘Tis a grand, victorious army;
    Lift its banner up on high!

3.    Never fear the clouds of sorrow;
    Never fear the storms of sin.
    We shall triumph on the morrow;
    Even now our joys begin.

4.    Wave the banner;
        shout His praises.
    For our victory is nigh!
    We shall join our conqu’ring
        Savior;
    We shall reign with Him on high!
