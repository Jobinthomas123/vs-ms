      G                                           C        G
1.	Years I spent in vanity and pride,
       D          D7                                 G-C-G
	Caring not my Lord was crucified,
                          C                       G
	Knowing not it was for me
               Em7         Am7-D-G
		He died on Calvary.

Chorus:
         C          Am7
	Mercy there was great,
                   G                Em7
		and grace was free;
       D             D7                           G    C   G
	Pardon there was multiplied to me.
         C               Am7
	There my burdened soul
                    G   Em7      Am7-D-G
		found liberty at Calvary.

2.	By God’s Word at last
		my sin I learned.
	Then I trembled at the Law
		I’d spurned,
	Till my guilty soul imploring
		turned to Calvary.

3.	Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus
		ev’rything;
	Now I gladly own Him
		as my King.
	Now my raptured soul
		can only sing of Calvary.

4.	Oh, the love that drew
		salvation’s plan!
	Oh, the grace that brought it
		down to man!
	Oh, the mighty gulf that God
		did span at Calvary!
