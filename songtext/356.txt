2.	Sorrow and sin prevaileth,

		Lord!”

	We do not know the day nor hour.
	Are you your hearts preparing
	Ascension robes, now wearing,
	Washed in the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb?

4.	So, when the trumpet soundeth
	And He from heav’n descendeth
	To claim the church,
		His spotless bride;
	With boundless joy
		We’ll greet Him,
	As we arise to meet Him.
	“Hasten Thy glorious coming,
		Lord!”
