1.	Deeper, deeper
		                             D
		in the love of Jesus
       A        B7          E - E7
	Daily let me go.
       A
	Higher, higher in the school
                D
		of wisdom—
         A              E               A
	More of grace to know.

Chorus:
               A           D          A — F#m7
	Oh, deeper yet, I pray,
                  E – E7              A
		and higher everyday,
                              D             A  -  F#m7
	And wiser, blessed Lord,
                        Bm             E          A
		in Thy precious, holy Word.

2.	Deeper, deeper
		blessed Holy Spirit,
	Take me deeper still—
	Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus,
	And His perfect will.

3.	Deeper, deeper
		though it cost hard trials,
	Deeper let me go!
	Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
	Let me fruitful grow.

4.	Deeper, higher
		ev’ry day in Jesus,
	Till all conflict past
	Finds me conqueror
		and in His own image—
	Perfected at last.
