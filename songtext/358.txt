A D
1.Who shall ascend
   AD
unto the hill of the Lord?
AD
And who shall stand
E
in His holy place?
A  D
He that has clean hands
   AD
and is pure in heart
ADE
And has not lifted up his soul.

Chorus:
F#m   C#m
I dwell in a people
D  A
whose heart is towards Me—
F#mC#m
A people whom I have chosen
D  E
and called them to Me.

2.Who shall abide
in Your tent, O Lord?
And who shall dwell
in Your Holy Hill?
He who walks upright
and does righteousness;
He that speaks the truth
in his own heart.

3.Who shall abide
under Your wings, O Lord?
And who shall rest
in all Your love?
He that makes the Lord
his own Refuge and Strength;
And he who trusts
with all his heart.

4.The Holy One of Israel
inhabits eternity,
And He dwells in a high
and lofty place.
In them that have a broken,
contrite, humble heart,
They’re the ones He chooses
to dwell on high.

5.Behold, the tabernacle
of God is with man,
And He will dwell forever
with them.
And they shall be His own people;
God shall be with them
and be their God.

(Ending)
I dwell in a heart of love;
I dwell with My dove;
A people whom I have loved,
a people for Me.
