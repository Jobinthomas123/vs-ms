                          D
1.	You have longed for sweet peace
                                             Bm
	And for faith to increase
                           D
	And have earnestly,
         A7                D
		fervently prayed.

	But you cannot have rest,
                                        Bm
		or be perfectly blest
                 D                A7           D
	Until all on the altar is laid.

Chorus:
                    G                Em
	Is your all on the altar
               D              Bm7
		of sacrifice laid?
                   G                            E7
	Your heart, does the Spirit
		          A  -  A7
		control?
                      D
	You can only be blest
                                                            Bm
	And have peace and sweet rest,
                       D                            A7
	As you yield Him your body
	              D
		 and soul.

2.	Would you walk with the Lord,
		in the light of His Word,
	And have peace and
		contentment always?
	You must do His sweet will
		to be free from all ill;
	On the altar your all you must lay.

3.	Oh, we never can know
		what the Lord will bestow
	Of the blessings
		for which we have prayed,
	Till our body and soul
		He doth fully control,
	And our all on the altar is laid.
