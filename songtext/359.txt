  D
1.You have longed for sweet peace
 Bm
And for faith to increase
   D
And have earnestly,
 A7D
fervently prayed.

But you cannot have rest,
Bm
or be perfectly blest
 DA7   D
Until all on the altar is laid.

Chorus:
GEm
Is your all on the altar
   D  Bm7
of sacrifice laid?
   GE7
Your heart, does the Spirit
  A  -  A7
control?
  D
You can only be blest
Bm
And have peace and sweet rest,
   DA7
As you yield Him your body
  D
 and soul.

2.Would you walk with the Lord,
in the light of His Word,
And have peace and
contentment always?
You must do His sweet will
to be free from all ill;
On the altar your all you must lay.

3.Oh, we never can know
what the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings
for which we have prayed,
Till our body and soul
He doth fully control,
And our all on the altar is laid.
