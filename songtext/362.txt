                    D      A
1.	I am Thine, O Lord;
                      D
	I have heard Thy voice,
                   G                Em7        D
	And it told Thy love to me.
                             A
	But, I long to rise
		               D            Bm
		in the arms of faith
                      Em          A               D
	And be closer drawn to Thee.

Chorus:
                               D7      G
	Draw me nearer, nearer,
           A            D
		blessed Lord,
                       G
	To the cross where
            Em            A     A7
		Thou hast died.
                          D             D7
	Draw me nearer, nearer,
          G                           Em
		nearer, blessed Lord,
                       D                        A       D
	To Thy precious, bleeding side.

2.	Consecrate me now
		to Thy service, Lord,
	By the powâ€™r of grace divine.
	Let my soul look up
		with a steadfast hope
	And my will be lost in Thine.

3.	Oh, the pure delight
		of a single hour
	That before Thy throne I spend.
	When I kneel in prayer,
		and with Thee, my God,
	I commune as friend with friend.

4.	There are depths of love
		that I cannot know
	Till I cross the narrow sea.
	There are heights of joy
		that I may not reach
	Till I rest in peace with Thee.
