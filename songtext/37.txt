  G                       D7        G — G7
	His name is Jesus, Jesus,
	  C                     G              D7
	Sad hearts weep no more.
	                 G
	He has healed
	                            G7
		the broken-hearted,
	                    C                            Am7
	Opened wide the prison doors,
	                     D7
	And He’s able to deliver
	                G
		evermore.
