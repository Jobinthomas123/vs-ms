          Dm
    A song shall be heard

        in the cities of Judah
    Gm                                         A7    Dm
    And in the streets of Jerusalem. x2

            F            Dm
    A song of joy,
            F               C
    A song of gladness,
                 Gm                  C7
    The voice of the Bridegroom,
                         A7                      Dm
        and the voice of the bride. x2
