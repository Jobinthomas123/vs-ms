1.Blessed be the Lord, my Strength,
 F  CDm
Who’ll teach my hands to war
   GmA7
And train my fingers how to fight.

Cast forth Your lightning, Lord;
 F   C Dm
destroy my enemies.
Gm
Shoot out Your arrows;
 A7
scatter them.

Chorus:
  Gm C
My Goodness, my Fortress,
   Dm
My Deliverer and Shield,
   C  Dm
My Lord God in whom I trust;
Gm  C
My Goodness, my Fortress,
   Dm Bb
High Tower and my Shield,
   Gm7   C   Dm
My Lord God in whom I trust.

2.Bow down Your heavens, Lord,
And make the mountains smoke.
Send from above
Your mighty hand;
Deliver me from evil.
God rescue me,
And save me from
the hurtful sword.

3.I’ll sing a new song unto Thee,
O Lord my God;
With music I will praise
Thy name.
Happy is that people, yes,
whose God is the Lord—
Who sing His praises evermore.
