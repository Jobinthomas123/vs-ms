	Why do you worry and fret,

		my soul?
F
	Why are you cast down
               C
		within me so?
F                                                     C
	Just hope in God, and believe,
                              G
	For I shall praise Him.

 C                                        Em
	Send out Your light and

		Your truth too.
F
	Let them bring me to
                      C
		Your holy hill;
F                                  C
	To Your tabernacle,
                                 G
	Oh, let them lead me.

Bb                         F

		and You are my God.
Bb                                F                    C
	To the altar of God, will I go—
Bb                             F                            C
	To God my delight, my great joy.
