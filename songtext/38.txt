	    G                            -C
	Spring up, O well,
	                           G
		within my soul.

	Spring up, O well,
	                       D7
		and overflow.
	                               G  -C
	Spring up, O well,
	                                       G
	Flow out through me.
	                                     -D7
	Spring up, O well,
	                        G
	Set others free.

	      G
	There’s a River of Life
	                   C                        G
	Flowing out through me.

	It makes the lame to walk
	                    A7         D7
	And the blind to see.
	G
	Opens prison doors,
	                   C                G
	Sets the captives free;

	There’s a River of Life
	                               D7       G
	Flowing out through me.
