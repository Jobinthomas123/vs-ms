       Dm
1.	Do not fear, and do not

		be dismayed
                         C
	By reason of this great
                                 Dm
		and mighty army. x2

Chorus:
                                 Gm
	Because the battle is

		not yours,
       Dm
	It is the Lordâ€™s. x3

A7                 Dm
	Do not fear.

2.	Stand firm and be still,
	And see the great salvation
	The Lord your God will give you. x2
