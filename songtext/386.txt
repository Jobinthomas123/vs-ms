    Blessed Jesus,

    Savior of our soul,
     D-Bm  Em7 A7        D
    Be exalted evermore.

2.    Open our ears and speak peace
        to our soul;
    Let healing flow,
        oh, make our body whole.
    Calm ev’ry fear, and
        each troubled heart console;
    Lord, draw us, much closer
        to Thee.

    Jesus, Thy blood gives us
        boldness to come.
    Sin’s debt is paid;
        salvation’s work is done.
    Battle’s been fought,
        and the victory is won
    Forever and evermore!

3.    Once we were blind;
        now Thy beauty we see.
    Glory divine, O holy Majesty!
    Make Thy face shine
        upon us eternally;
    Don’t leave us, Lord Jesus,
        please stay.

    Oh, what a joy to be here
        with Thee, Lord—
    One family gathered
        in one accord.
    Fellowship sweet in Thy kingdom
        —our reward,
    Together, forever with Thee!
