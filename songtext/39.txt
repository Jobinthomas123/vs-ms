  G
	John saw the multitude

		of the overcomers,

	And all of them were
	                                       D7
		worshipping the Lord.

	Some of them were singing,

	Some of them were shouting,

	But all of them were
	                                       G
		worshipping the Lord.


	Oh, praise the Lord!

	Oh, praise the Lord!
	    D7                                     G
	Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! x2
