1.	I have found a friend in Jesus;
		          A                            E
		He’s everything to me.
                        E                            C#m7
	He’s the fairest of ten thousand
                    F#m7 – B7
		to my soul.
               E                    E7
	The Lily of the valley,
               A                      E
		in Him alone I see,

	All I need to cleanse
                   B7                            E    —E7
		and make me fully whole.
            A                              F#m
	In sorrow He’s my comfort,
               E
		in trouble He’s my stay;
                                        C#m7
	He tells me ev’ry care
                            F#m7 – B7
		on Him to roll.

Chorus:
                         E                   E7
	He’s the Lily of the valley,
                  A                                      E
		the Bright and Morning Star;
                                                    B7
	He’s the fairest of ten thousand
                      E
		to my soul.

2.	He all my grief has taken
		and all my sorrows borne;
	In temptation He’s my strong
		and mighty tow’r.
	I have all for Him forsaken
		and all my idols torn
	From my heart, and now
		He keeps me by His pow’r.
	Though all the world forsake me,
		and Satan tempts me sore,
	Through Jesus I shall safely
		reach the goal.

3.	He will never, never leave me
		nor yet forsake me here
	While I live by faith and do His
		blessed will.
	A wall of fire about me,
		I’ve nothing now to fear,
	With His manna He my hungry
		soul shall fill.
	Then sweeping up to glory,
		to see His blessed face
	Where rivers of delight
		shall ever roll!
