                  E
    I will lift my eyes
                        B
        to the mountains;
                      E
    From where comes my help
                        B
        and salvation?


                Bm7      E7
    My help, it comes
                             A
        from the Lord,
                  F#m           B
    The Maker of heaven
                        E
        and of earth. x2

    He will not allow your feet
                E
        to stumble;
                       B7
    He that keeps you,
                                       E
        He will never slumber.
            Am7                   D7
    Behold, He will never sleep,
                 E                               C#m7
        no, neither shall He slumber.
               F#m
    The Lord Who watches
        A              B
        over Israel,
               F#m
    The Lord Who watches
        A             B
        over Israel;
        B7                E     —A – E - B
    He never sleeps.

    The Lord is your keeper, Israel!
                                            A
    The Lord is your shade
                                          E
        upon your right hand;
                G#
    The sun will not harm you
                 C#m
         by day,
                                                    F#m
    Nor by night shall the moon
         A        B
         ever hurt you. x2


                E
    The Lord, He will preserve you

        from all harm;
       A                                        E
    He watches over your life.
                G#
    The Lord will keep you
                                                 C#m
        in your coming and going
                  A                   B
    Both now and forever.
               F#m            A             B
    Both now and even forever,
                 A                              B
    Both now and even forever,
               B7           E
         forevermore!
