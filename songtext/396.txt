  C                           G/B
1.    In Thy lovingkindness
                                Am               Am/G
        Thou hast dealt with me.
F                                      C
    How shall I now fear?
                       Dm7     G4 – G
    Thou art with me. x2

Chorus:
F                                       C                      E
    For, Thou hast delivered my soul
                                 Am
        from out of death
F                      C                Dm7    G4-G
    And my feet from falling.
F                                 C
    So that I may walk,
              E                              Am
        before Thee O my God;
                  Dm7                  G
    In the light, in the light
                     C
        of the living.

2.    Yea, now in the shadow
        of Thy wings I trust,
    For I’ve found in Thee
        a sweet refuge. x2

3.    All Thy vows, O God,
        are now constraining me,
    All that I can do
        is sing praises. x2
