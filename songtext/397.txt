    D              F#m7                           G
     As we gather may Your Spirit
                      A6     A
        work within us;
    D             F#m7                      G
    As we gather may we glorify
                     A4 – A
        Your name.
    G                    A                               D
     Knowing well that as our hearts
             A/C#      Bm
        begin to worship,
Em7                A6
    We’ll be blessed
                                  D – A/C#-Bm
        because we came;
Em7                   A
    We’ll be blessed
                                  D
        because we came.
