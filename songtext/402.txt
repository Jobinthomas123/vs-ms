	Jesus Christ my Lord!
F#m               E                      B
	There is no one like You!

	I’ll love You with all
		              E                 A/E
		of my heart— forever,
            E                           B7                E

2.	Was there ever any
	So kind, so tender and pure;
	Who delights in mercy,
	Whose love shall ever endure?

3.	Who was born of a virgin,
	The Lamb without spot or guile—
	Son of God and of man,
	So holy and undefiled?

4.	Who alone was willing
	To bear my sins and my shame?
	Was there any other
	Who’d die and suffer such pain?

5.	Who has risen up from
	The grave, alive evermore,
	With a shout of triumph
	To make our victory sure?

6.	Who alone is worthy
	Of all the blessing and praise?
	Who is now exalted
	On high the Ancient of Days?

7.	Who will always be there
	To help when I need a friend?
	Is there one so faithful
	Whom I can trust to the end?
