             Gm
1.	He humbled Himself
		                      D
		and came down to earth;
                                                 Gm
	He left His majesty above.

	He took on the form
                       D
		of the Son of Man;
                                                                    Gm
	The Word of God in flesh was He.

Chorus:
        D#     Dm                Cm
	How great is His love!
               D#                          Dm
	To Him praise and honor
                    Gm
		now bring.
     D#          Dm               Cm
	Every knee shall bow
            D#                 Dm                G
	Before Christ Jesus, the King!

2.	He could have proclaimed Himself King of kings,
	But chose to be the least of all;
	No glory, no honor
		He sought from men,
	But sought His Father’s
		praise instead.

3.	He prayed to the Father
		to do His will—
	The hearts of fallen men to win;
	He healed all the sick
		and forgave their sin
	To show the love of God for man.

4.	He came as a lamb
		for the sacrifice;
	So holy, without spot was He.
	He poured out His soul,
		and His blood was shed
	To pay the penalty of sin.

5.	God raised Jesus up
		from the cruel grave
	To break the chains
		of sin and death!
	He sits on the right hand
		of God above;
	He’s King of kings
		and Lord of lords.
