   E                 G#m
1.	I do not know why the
	    C#m                          E – C#m
		Savior loves me so,
                                          F#m
	Why He gave His life
                          B
	 	on Calvary;
   E                                      G#m
	 Oh, what grace divine,
                        C#m
	Bowing down to men
	         E-C#m
		so low!
                                    F#m
	How could He pay such a price
                 B
		for  me?

Chorus:
  A                           B
	It’s only because
                                 E
	He loves the ones
            B/D#                       C#m
	He made with His very

		own hands;
  A                         B
	It’s only because He wants
                  E
		 His joy
                 B/D#      C#m
	And peace to fill our land.
  A                          B                           E
	It’s only because He is our God!

2.	His name was Jesus and they nailed Him to a cross,
	They just didn’t like the
		things He said;
	Laid Him in His grave
		and this world’s still at loss,
	To explain how He rose
		from the dead.

3.	Sometimes I wonder why He
		waits so patiently,
	How could He love such a one
		as I?
	Many times I’ve failed
		and I’ve acted foolishly,
	But His goodness He will
		ne’er deny.
