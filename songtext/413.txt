1.How beautiful is Jesus my Lord;

The fairest of all is He.

No greater joy will this life afford
  F G  C
Than with Him to be.

Chorus:

To Him I belong,

forever His own,
  F G Am
My joy and my song,

2.Like flowers in the earliest spring
The fragrance of His sweet love;
Such quietness His presence
will bring,
Like fair, gentle dove.

3.There’s no one in the heaven above
Nor here on the earth below
That like my blessed Savior
I love and long more to know.
