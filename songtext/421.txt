Chorus:
                         D                    G
    By the blood of the Lamb
                         D                    G
    And the word of our testimony,
        G   D/F# Em-D-A
    We have overcome!
                         D                     G
    By the blood of the Lamb
                         D                    G
    And the word of our testimony,
        G   D/F# Em-A-D
    We have overcome!

                     D         G            D
1.    It is no longer I who live,
                D                         G             A4 - A
    But Christ Whoâ€™s living in me.

2.    Anyone joined to Christ is new;
    Old things have now passed away.

3.    There is no other name but Christ
    By which a man can be saved.
