     G     D/G             Bm7   Cma7 - Am7
1.	As each day passes by,
             D7                            G
		I feel my love run dry;
        D/G         Bm7     Cma7 -  Am7
	I get so weary-worn
                 D7                                      G
		and tossed ‘round in the storm.
               Em7       Bm7        Cma7 -  Am7
	I’m blind to others’ needs;
                 D7                            G
		I’m tired of planting seeds.
          D/G         Bm7    Cma7 -  Am
	I seem to have a wealth of so
           D7
		many thoughts about myself;

Chorus:
G                   Bm
	I want to, I need to
	C                           G        -D
		be more like Jesus.
G                   Bm
	I want to, I need to
	C                            D
		be more like Him,
                                  G
	Be more like Him.

2.	Our Father’s will was done
		by giving us His Son,
	Who paid the highest cost
		to point us to the cross,
	And, when I think of Him
		Who took the whole world’s sin,
	I take one look at me compared
		to what I’m called to be.

3.	The end of all my prayers—
		to care like my Lord cares.
	My one and only goal—
		His image in my soul.
	My weakness is revealed,
		but by His stripes I’m healed;
	He’s faithful and He’s true
		to complete the work He begins in you.
