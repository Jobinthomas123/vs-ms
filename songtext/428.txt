        D         Bm      Em                    A
1.    Certainly, I shortly will return.
   D                            Bm
    This Word is faithful
                      Em               A
        and it must be fulfilled,
  G                           A
    And I shall bring with Me
                F#m - Bm
        reward
Em                      A                            D
    To give to him who out of love
                    D7
        truly served Me
  G                         A
    And who in every trial
          F#m                          Bm
        has been proven true,
                 E
    Who lived victoriously,
   Em                                  A
        whose hope is in Me.

Chorus:
         D         F#
    Come quickly,
          Bm
        come back quickly, Lord!
              Em7
    I’m longing to see
                        A – A7
        Your return.
        D          F#
    Come quickly,
          Bm
        come back quickly, Lord!
                    Em7
    To be caught up
                                               A
        to Your presence, Lord,
             A7             D
    For all eternity!

2.    Yes, I know that soon
        You shall return;
    The time is short now,
        yet there’s still much to do!
    O Lord, perfect in me, I pray,
    That work of grace, now,
        that Calvary’s love started.
    Lord, You have promised,
        so I wait expectantly;
    I’m trusting in Your Word,
        it’s faithful and true!
