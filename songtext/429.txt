Chorus:
    D                            G
	I will sing to You, O Lord,
                  D                    —G
		with all my heart;
    D                                Bm
	I will climb the mountain
                        Em — A
		of my God.
    D                                 G
	I will seek Your face now,
           D
		praying ev’ry day
                                    A
	Till I see Your coming,
                         D     —D7
		O dear Lord.

                                G
1.	Now on that day He will
          A                        F#m7    —Bm7
		 rapture us to heaven,
                                    Em
	And we’ll be changed in the
        A                              D  –  D7
		likeness of His Son.
                                 G
	And, all our battles
                  A                      F#m7 — Bm7
		and trials will be over;
                              E
	We shall depart to live forever
                            A – A7
		with the Lord.

2.	When Jesus comes
		for His saints in all His glory,
	Then He will reap all the labor
		of His love.
	And, He will take for Himself
		His perfect bride—
	The faithful church
		that He redeemed
	With His own blood.
