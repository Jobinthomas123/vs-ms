	The Spirit is moving.

	All over the world

	As the prophets said
	                      C
		it would be;

	All over the world
	                                             F
	Thereâ€™s a mighty revelation
	                                         C
	Of the glory of the Lord,
	                G7                             C
	As the waters cover the sea.
