1.Hard times may come
G6  D
When I’m walking with my Lord,
 F#m
Feel I’m being swept away
   A E7  A
by tempest storms.
 D   D7
But, my roots deeper they grow
G  Em
Planted in Jesus’ love;
   Em7F#m
Like a tree, I’m standing firm,
  G A
And I will never be moved.

Chorus:
   D
I’m like a tree that’s planted
 GD
by living waters;

Hard times they may come,
   E7
But the Lord will bring me
 A
through.
   G   D
Even in the howling desert,
  Em   A
When all hope is gone it seems –
Em
I am planted
 GAD
 by God’s living stream.
 G A
When heat and dry times come,
  BmG
My leaf stays fresh and green
  DBm
‘Cause I am planted
 Em7   A   D
 by God’s living stream.

2.Sometimes I pass
Through a long and lonely night;
Clouds of darkness hide His face—
No hope in sight;
But, I’ll wait, patient in hope,
Holding His promise sure.
Like the sun
at dawn breaks through,
He’ll shine upon me once more!
