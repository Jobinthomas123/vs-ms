               A                                 D
1.	I’ve truly known the good life
                              E7                    A
	Filled with family and friends.
     D
	I’ve been blessed
                   E7                                     A
	With much more than my share;
                                Bm7
	And yet with all
                                  E
		of my good fortune,
              E/G# A                      D
	My heart is seeking still.
                 A                     D
	No, I just can’t deny
                                   A     —E
		the longing there.

Chorus:
               A          D/A
	It’s Jesus I really want
		       A    —E
		to see.
	          A             D/A
	It’s Jesus I really want
		      Bm7  —E
		to see.
	            A                       A/G
	The more I see of this world,
               D/F#                      Dm/F
	The less it means to me;
                       A            Bm7      E            A
	And it’s Jesus I really want to see.

2.	I’ve been a lot of places,
	And I’ve known the great
		and small;
	I have seen the noble works
		of men.
	But, in the heart of my own heart,
	I know there’s more for me—
	So much more than
	This fading world at hand.
