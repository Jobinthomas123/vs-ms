  D   Dma7
1.I just came into His presence,
  Am/G
And my feet are standing
D7/F#   D7 G
on the hallowed ground;
B/F#  Em
Seems I’m close enough
  Em7
to touch Him,
 A9
And my heart can hear Him
  D
speak without a sound.

Something whispers,
   Dma7
“Stand, be silent.
   Am/G  D7/F#
Let His glory fill the temple
   G
through and through”.
 B/F#   Em  Em7
I just came into His presence,
   A9
In the Holy Place with Jesus,
  D
Allelu!

Chorus:
 Em7— A7 D — Bm
Allelu,   —Allelu,
   Em7   Bm/F#
I just came into His presence,
 G   E/G#A7
Al — le — lu !
 Em7—A7   D — Bm
Allelu,  —  Allelu,
   Em7 A7
I just came into His presence,
   D
Allelu!

2.I just came into His presence,
And I sense a thousand angels
hov’ring near;
And my soul cannot contain
The sound of glory Hallelujahs
that I hear.
For, the brightness of His face
Excels the brightness of the stars
in magnitude.
I just came into His presence,
In the Holy Place with Jesus,
Allelu!
