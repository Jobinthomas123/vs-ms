           D                           A/C#
1.    I make my life a prayer to You;
           Bm
    I want to do what
                    Bm/A
        You want me to—
               G
    No empty words and
         A
        no white lies,
             G
    No token prayers,
               A
        no compromise.
           D                           A/C#
    I wanna shine the light You gave
            Bm
    Through Your Son
                  Bm/A
        You sent to save us
         G                                  A
    From ourselves and our despair;
           G                               A
    It comforts me to know
                                       D
        You’re really there.

Chorus:
           D                                  A/C#
    I wanna thank You, Lord,
                             Bm                 Bm/A
        for being patient with me.
             G                            D/F#
    Oh, it’s so hard to see
                            Em7                A
        when my eyes are on me!
          D                                A/C#
    I guess I’ll have to trust
                               Bm                         Bm/A
    And just believe what You say;
                              G                D/F#
    Oh, You’re coming again,
                             Em7              A
        coming to take me away!

2.    I wanna die and let You give
    Your life to me so that
        I might live,
    And share the hope You
        gave to me—
    The love of Christ that set me free.
    I wanna tell the world out there
    You’re not some fable or fairy tale
    That I made up inside my head.
    You’re God the Son;
    You’re risen from the dead.
