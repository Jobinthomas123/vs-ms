Chorus:
      D                  A/D  G/D
	How lovely is Your
                 D
		dwelling place,
Em7     A            D
	Almighty Lord.
         Bm
	There’s a hunger
          E7                         A
		deep inside my soul.
       D    A/D   G/D          D
	Only in Your presence
                        F#
	Are my heart and mind
              Bm — Bm/A
		restored;
                 G
	How lovely is Your
             A              D
		dwelling place.

            G/D
1.	Oh, in Your courts
          A/D         D
		there’s shelter
                      G/D                 A/D     D
	For the greatest and the small.
                    Em           D/F#       G
	Even sparrows have a place
              G/A      A       D
		to build their nest.
                F                             Em
	The pilgrim finds refreshment
            Dm                             B/D#
		in all the rains that fall,
                Em7                                  E7
	And each one finds the strength
                                A4 – A
		to meet the test.

2.	A single day is better
	Which is spent in humble praise,
	Than a thousand days of living
		without You!
	The Lord bestows His favor
		on each one who obeys,
	And blessings on the man
		whose heart is true.
