	Lord, You know I need
             Em
		a brand new touch;
A                                        G
	My strength from yesterday
              D
		is gone.
                                                      D7
	But, if You’ll give me, Lord,
            Em
		another touch,
A7                                                           D
	I’ll have the strength to carry on!
