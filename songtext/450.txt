Singing praises to our God

1.I will rejoice in
   C  G
 the work of Thy hands,
 C DG
For Thou hast made me glad;
   Fma7
Mine enemies scatter—
  Em  Ama7
they fall away;
F   D4 – D
But the righteous one shall stand.

2.And, from the strings of our instruments here
My offering it will pour,
For He is my Rock and my Righteousness;
I’ll exalt Him evermore.
