Chorus:
            D7
    It reaches
                C/E  –-  D7/F#   G
        the high —  est  mountain;
            D7                 C/G – D7/F# G
    It flows to the low - est   valley.

2.    It cleanses me from all my fears,
    And it dries all my tears;
    The blood that brings my heart
        such perfect peace,
    It will never lose its power!

3.    Eternally  I’ll ever sing,
    To Jesus Christ my King!
    To think of what my Lord
        has done for me—
    Wondrous blood
        that set me free.
