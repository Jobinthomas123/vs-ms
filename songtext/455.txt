Chorus:
                   A
    If  we walk in the light
                D                   Bm
        as He is in the light,
                          A
    We have  fellowship
       F#m               Bm —-E7
        one with another;
                            A                              A7
    And the blood of Jesus Christ
           D                         Bm
        cleanses ev’ry sin,
                    A                  F#m
    If we walk in the light
             Bm      E            A
        as He is in the light.

                        E
1.    Once in darkness  we were bound,
              D                                      A
    But by His blood we’re free;
                      E
    So that now as sons of God,
              D                     E
    We live in victory.

2.    It’s the love of Jesus Christ
    That’s shining in our heart;
    So now let that same light shine,
    And life to all impart.
