                   D                           Gma7
1.	In the very thought of Jesus,
               F#m                          Bm
	His presence can be found;
                       G                    G/D   D
	He’s as close as the mention
                       Em —- A7
		of His name.
                        D                Gma7
	There is never any distance
               F#m                            Bm
	Between my Lord and me;
                        G                     A7
	He’s as close as the mention
                         D
		of His name.

Chorus:
       G/A A7    D                    Gma7
	He’s as close as the mention
                       F#m – D7     Gma7- G6-D/A-A
		of His name:        Jesus,     Jesus.
                        D                    Gma7
	He’s as close as the mention
                    F#m –D7   Gma7- G6-Em-A7-D
		of His name:    Jesus,      Jesus.

2.	Oh, and in my hour of struggle
	So many times I’ve found,
	He’s as close as the mention
		of His name.
	Just to breathe the name of Jesus
	Turns everything around;
	He’s as close as the mention
		of His name.
