Come unto Jesus,
B7 A  E
Give Him your life today;

Come unto Jesus,
B7A B7   E
Let Him have His way.


1.Oh, I know
F#m
there are things in your life
B7  A E
You think He can’t forgive;
 F#m
But He will forgive, my friend,
B7   E
He’ll show you how to live.

2.Don’t delay,
oh, my friend, please obey.
You can’t afford to wait;
Today is the day for you,
Soon it could be too late!
