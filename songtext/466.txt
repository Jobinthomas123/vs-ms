Chorus
 G
	The Lord’s my Shepherd;
Em7                             —D—
		I lack in nothing.
C
	He makes me lie down
               G/D-D            C    —D—
		in pastures of green;
G
	He leads me onward
Em7
		by whispering waters,
	              C
	He restores my soul
	               G/B
	And guides me
                     Am7  C/D         G
		for the sake of His name.

D/F# - Em                               Bm7
1.			If I should journey through
         C                      D         G
		death’s dark valley land,
Em                        G7
	I know there is no need
             C—D
		to fear;
 Em               G7                      Cma7
	I am protected by the staff
                          B7
		in Your hand,
	                    Em                        G/A
	And I’m comforted just knowing
          A                   D
		that You’re near.

2.	You’ve spread a table in the
		midst of evry foe;
	You fill my cup now
		with Your love.
	Your tender mercies are
		with me as I go,
	And I’ll dwell forever
		in Your house above.
