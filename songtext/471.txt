                              E
1.    Our God is good
                                F#m
    And God is great
                 B7          E
    And God is true,

    And there is nothing
                        C#m7
        in this world
                             F#m–B
    He cannot do.
                               E
    His mighty hands were made
            E7                 A-F#m
        available to you;
                                       E
    Oh, praise His name—
                            F#m      B7         E
    He’s on the other side of faith!

Chorus:
                                 F#m7-B7
    Keep pressing on.
                                  E
    Keep pressing on.
                              C#m7
    God’s on the other side
              F#m7-B7
        of faith;
                                   E
    And tho’ the clouds may
                     E7                             A-F#m
        for a moment hide His face,
                                E
    Remember, God is on
               F#m     B           E
        the other side of faith.

2.    Now threat’ning clouds may hide
        your vision for a while,
    And you may wonder
        if He hears you
    When you pray;
    But don’t forget that God is love
        and you’re His child.
    Press on in faith because
        the answer’s on the way!

3.    Now you must run this race
        to win the victor’s crown,
    Though Satan try
        with all his might
    To cast you down;
    It will be worth it just to hear
        God say, “Well done!”
    Press toward the prize
    That’s on the other side of faith!
