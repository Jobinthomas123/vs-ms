		of the valley;
                   G
	He is brighter than
                  A               D
		the morning star.
                  G
	He is purer than

		the snow,
 D                                      Bm
	Fresher than the breeze,
       Em                 A
	Lovelier by far than
                      D
		all of these.

                 D                            G/D   D
	And conquers the raging seas;
C/D                                       G/D
	He is the High and Lofty One
                      D                G/D-D
	Who inhabits eternity,
G                 A           D
	Creator of the universe,

Em                    G                            A
	He is and evermore shall be.
