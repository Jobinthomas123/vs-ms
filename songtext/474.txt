                        D
1.	What a glory stored in heaven
                                        A         D
	Such as eye has never seen.

	Now a kingdom all through ages

	For the saints from earth
             A
		redeemed;
                                  G                     D
	Where sweet voices ever mingle,
                             G
	Sound like harps
                                   D
		before the throne.

	They are firstfruits

		of redemption
                                 A               D
	To His perfect image grown.

Chorus:
	See on Zion’s Holy Mount,
        A                D
		lo, they stand.
                                                 A
	See on Zion’s Holy Mount,
       E                 A-A7
		lo, they stand.
                 D
	They see the Father’s face,
                G                                       D
	And serve Him night and day;

	See on Zion’s Holy Mount,
       A                 D
		lo, they stand.

2.	These are they that bring
		Good Tidings;
	On the mountains see their feet.
	They have toiled to make them
		shining,
	And they never knew retreat;
	They with Jesus are now standing,
	Without fault before the throne.
	With a voice that sounds
		like thunder,
	They do sing a brand-new song.

3.	Serving Me with single vision,
	Hence to Zion called are they;
	From their holy habitation,
	All their strength and zeal display.
	Father’s name in forehead written,
	They forever His shall be;
	God has loved the gates of Zion,
	Joy of all the earth is she.



4.	Where I am there be My servants
	For they dared to follow Me;
	Once despised on earth
		they wandered
	From dark caves to raging sea.
	Followed Me, the Lamb so gentle,
	Choosing not to seek their plan;
	Reign with Me above all heavens,
	For the race they wholly ran.

5.	Hear, O earth, for thee
		He’s calling,
	Seeking now the great and small;
	With a lowly heart and tender,
	Trusting Him you’ll never fall.
	Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
	Give a signal sign for all;
	Heavens sing with solemn praises,
	Go ye forth for harvest call.
