           G       G7
1.    What a fellowship,
           C       Am
    What a joy divine,
       G           Em                  G           D
    Leaning on the everlasting arms;
           G          G7
    What a blessedness,
            C        Am
    What a peace is mine,
       G           Em                  G    D   G
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Chorus:
      G               C   —Am
    Leaning, leaning,
      G                    Em            G       D7
    Safe and secure from all alarms;
       G              C—Am
    Leaning, leaning,
       G            Em                 G     D   G
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.

2.    Oh, how sweet to walk
        in this pilgrim way,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms;
    Oh, how bright the path grows
        from day to day,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.

3.    What have I to dread?
    What have I to fear—
    Leaning on the everlasting arms?
    I have blessed peace
        with my Lord so near,
    Leaning on the everlasting arms.
