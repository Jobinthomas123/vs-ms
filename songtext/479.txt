        Satan’s every host.
           C                                 D
    Christ rose from the dead!

    Resurrection power
       A

              B7                         Em—A
        to live triumphantly
     G           Gdim               Am

        His glory be seen.

2.    Full of grace and glory,
        full of sovereign pow’r;
    Jesus leads us on victoriously!
    Darkness now surrounds us
        —it’s the final hour;
    The battle may seem long,
        but His love makes us strong!
    Soon we’ll sing with Christ
        our victory song!
