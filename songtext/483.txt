1.Down at the cross
  CG
where my Savior died,

Down where for cleansing
   A7   D
from sin I cried—
  G   G7
There to my heart
   C  G
was the blood applied;
  DG
Glory to His name!

Chorus:
 C  G
Glory to His name!
Em  A7-D
Glory to His name!

There to my heart
   C  G
was the blood applied;
  D G
Glory to His name!

2.I am so wondrously
saved from sin;
Jesus so sweetly abides within.
There at the cross
where He took me in—
Glory to His name!

3.Oh, precious fountain
that saves from sin—
I am so glad I have entered in.
There Jesus saves me
and keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

4.Come to the fountain
so rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul
at the Savior’s feet.
Plunge in today
and be made complete;
Glory to His name!
