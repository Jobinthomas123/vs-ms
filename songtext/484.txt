      A                      Bm7                  E
1.    You are the Light of the world,
              A
        O Lord,
                 D                              E
    And You make Your servants
         A
        shine.
              D                              E
    So, how could there be
                  C#                 F#m
        any darkness in me,
            D                       E
    If You are the Light
                    C#/F—F#m
        of the world?
       D                       E                     A
    You are the Light of the world.

2.    You are the Bread of Life, O Lord,
    Broken to set us free.
    So, how could there be
        any hunger in me,
    If You are the Bread of Life;
    You are the Bread of Life.

3.    You’ve overcome the world,
        O Lord,
    And given us victory;
    So, how could I fear
        when the enemy’s near,
    If You’ve overcome the world?
    You’ve overcome the world.

4.    Wipe every tear away, O Lord,
    And teach us the song
        of the Lamb;
    Your promise is true,
        but it’s still up to You,
    To wipe every tear away,
        wipe every tear away!
