    Delight yourself

        now in the Lord;

    Oh, do not fret but cast
                         C                            G
        all your cares upon the Lord!

    Let’s praise Him now
               Am7              D
    For His faithfulness
                              G
        will never cease!

Em                        D
1.    Rest in the Lord,
                              C                              G
        in trusting love wait patiently;
Em                        D                  C
    All your desire in the Lord
                                D
        you shall receive.
Em                       D
    Be now content in Him
                    C                                  G
        and know what you possess—
Em                         D
    Far greater wealth when you are
        C                                A—Am
        rich in righteousness —
              C       D7     G
    His righteousness.

2.    Commit your ways unto the Lord
        Who cares for you;
    His grace is great and His love
        will bring you through.
    Though you may stumble
        and may find it’s hard to stand,
    Trust in His Word and don’t forget
        Who holds your hand—
    He’ll hold your hand.
