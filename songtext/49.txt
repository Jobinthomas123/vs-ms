           D                              G
    Sweet honey in the rock,
                                            D
    Sweet honey in the rock,

    Jesus tastes like honey
                    A
        in the rock.
                                 D-D7
    Oh, taste and see
                                       G
    That the Lord is good,
                      D                 A7
    For He tastes like honey
                    D
        in the rock.
