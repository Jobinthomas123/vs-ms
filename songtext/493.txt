                                C-F/C               C-Am
1.    The love of God is greater far,
                                    Dm7-G7
    Than tongue or pen
                              C-F/C
        could ever tell;
                           C — Dm7
    It goes beyond
                                 Em7— Edim
        the highest star
                              Dm7-G                 C-C7
    And reaches to the lowest hell.
                          F-Dm7
    The guilty pair bowed down
                 Em7-Am7
        with care,
                                   Dm7-G    C-C7
    God gave His Son to win;
                         F-G/F                Em7-Edim
    His erring child He reconciled
                                  Dm7-G     Gm7-C7
    And pardoned from his sin.

Chorus:
                           F-Dm7
    O love of God,
                 G                Em7-Am7
        how rich and pure!
                                 Dm7-G      Gm7-C7
    How measureless and strong!
                       F—G/F                Em7-Edim
    It shall forevermore endure—
                                    Dm7-G    C
    The saints’ and angels’ song.

2.    Could we with ink the ocean fill,
    And were the skies
        of parchment made;
    Were every stalk on earth a quill,
    And every man a scribe by trade;
    To write the love of God above
        would drain the ocean dry;
    Nor could the scroll
        contain the whole
    Tho’ stretched from sky to sky.
