Chorus:
         A                  D
    Arise! Shine! For thy light
              A
        is come! x2
                          D
    And the glory of the Lord
              Bm
        is risen,
                 D                                    Bm
    The glory of the Lord is come,
                 D
    The glory of the Lord
              Bm  E           A
        is risen upon thee!

  D                           E
1.    Awake, O church, put on
                   A
        thy glory,
  D                               E
    And clothe thyself
                                 A
        in righteousness.
  C#
    O let thy voice be heard
                       F#m
        throughout the whole earth;
B7
    This is the hour
                           E   B7      E
        of God’s saving grace!

2.    Lift up the standard for all people;
    Restore the truth that once
        was lost.
    Build up the highway, now,
        of God’s holiness;
    Let vict’ry’s banner now
        be held up high.

3.    These are the days of restoration,
    For out of Zion God has shined;
    Oh, do not rest from prayer
        till God’s work is done—
    Till all the church becomes
        His glorious bride.

4.    Now when the Lord has built up Zion
    And filled Jerusalem with praise,
    In glory He’ll return
        and call unto thee,
    “Rise up, My love,
        and come away with Me!”
