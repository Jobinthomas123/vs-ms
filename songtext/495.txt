    God is here with us,
             F
    As certain as the air
                  G             C          —C7
        that we are breathing.
             F                                           G
    As certain as the morning sun
           Em                        A7
        arises day after day,
              Dm
    He promises He’ll never
         G
        leave us;
                                       C
    He’s with us to stay.
