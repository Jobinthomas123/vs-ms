	Oh, glory to God
	                G               D
	He has lifted me up.
	                                  E7          A
	He has lifted me up, I know.
	                 D                             D7
	He has reached out His hand,
	                  G                D
	And He lifted me up,
	                                    A                  D
	And that’s why I love Him so.
	                                               A
	I love Him more and more.
	   Em                 A7               D
	I love Him more and more,
	                            D7
	And when I stand
		     G                          Em
		upon the other shore,
	           A                    A7               D
	I’ll praise Him more and more.
