     E4                   E
	Hear all ye kings,
                E4                  E
	Give ear all ye princes,
                          C#m
	For I, even I
                                           F#m7-B7
		will sing unto the Lord.
    F#m7                B7
	I will sing praise
                     F#m                     B7
		to the Lord God of Israel;
    F#m                  B7                          E
	I will sing praise unto the Lord.
