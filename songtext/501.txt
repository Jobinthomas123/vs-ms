    Singing is a pleasure to the Lord,
                        G                     Em
    For He inhabits the praises
                       D-D7
        of His people;
        G                                C/G      G-Em
    Dancing is a joy unto His heart,
                         G                     D7
    So I will sing, I will dance
                            G
        unto the Lord.
