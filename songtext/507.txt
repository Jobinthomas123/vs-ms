       E             E7             A
1.    Living below in this
                              E
        old sinful world,
                       C#m7                  F#m7—B7
    Hardly a comfort can afford.
         E             E7           A
    Striving alone to face
                                 E
        temptations sore,
                                    E
    Where could I go
               B7          E
        but to the Lord?

Chorus:
            E                    E7
    Where could I go,
               A                      E
    O where could I go
                           C#m7                F#m7-B7
    Seeking a refuge for my soul?
        E                  E7             A
    Needing a friend to help me
                     E
        in the end,
                                   E
    Where could I go but
       B7          E
        to the Lord?

2.    Neighbors are kind;
        I love them ev’ry one.
    We get along in sweet accord,
    But when my soul needs
        manna from above,
    Where could I go but to the Lord?

3.    Life here is grand with friends
        I love so dear;
    Comfort I get from God’s
        own Word.
    Yet, when I face the chilling
        hand of death,
    Where could I go but to the Lord?
