                    D
1.	In my Lord there’s peace
                 G — Em
		and safety
                  D                                 A
	As I walk in His sweet will;
              D            D7        G — Em
	If I give my all to Jesus,
                   D                   A        D
	I shall reach the Holy Hill.

Chorus:
                           D
	Speak, O Master, speak to me;

	Speak, my soul doth thirst
                   A
		for Thee.
                       D            D7
	Lord, I want to be in
                G  —— Em
		the rapture,
                           D                 A             D
	When the saints are gathered in.

2.	It’s the narrow way I’ve taken,
	In my pilgrim life on earth;
	Leaving all the world
		and pleasures,
	Seeking now Thy kingdom first.

3.	Yoked together with my Jesus,
	I do satisfaction find;
	All my life, to Thee surrendered—
	Not my will, but only Thine.

4.	Oh, the love of God to mortals,
	Human mind cannot conceive!
	Now with open heart I’m waiting,
	All Thy grace, Lord, to receive.

5.	Keep me faithful in the battle,
	In the darkest hour of strife,
	As a shining light in darkness,
	Holding forth the Word of Life!

6.	When I think of all the treasures
	Stored in heaven just for me;
	When I’m raptured  up to glory,
	I shall rule and reign with Thee.
