                        D
1.    Well, I guess you’ve heard
                    D7
        the story,
                             G7                    D
    How in the Bible it was told

    Of the three little Hebrew children
                             E7                         A7
    And all the idols made of gold,
                       D
    How the evil king commanded
                              D7
    That every knee
                                       G
        should bow to Baal.

    They said, “Do what you must,
                    D
        we’ll put our trust
                   A7                             D
    In the God that cannot fail!”


Chorus:
    D7                         G
    For He’s the great God Jehovah—
               D
    So greatly to be praised;

    He’s the God that’ll take us over
                     E7                            A7
    Every mountain sin has raised.
                    D
    Out of all the gods men worship,
                          D7                                 G
    There’s a difference you can tell;

    He’s the only One
                             D
        who ever gave His Son.
                        A7                             D
    He’s the God that cannot fail!


2.    Now they were bound,
        and yet determined,
    As in the furnace they
        were thrown;
    But the king came
        and soon discovered
    They weren’t a-walkin’ in the
        fire alone.
    When he came up to the furnace,
    And he first looked over the rail,
    He saw Shadrach, Meshach,
        Abed-nego,
    And the God that cannot fail!


3.    Well, the fourth Man
        in the furnace,
    He was the blessed Son of God;
    He had eyes like a flame of fire,
    His feet with burning brass
        they were shod.
    His face like the sun was shining.
    How His fire surely prevailed;
    What a glory was there,
        what a joy they shared
    With the God that cannot fail!
