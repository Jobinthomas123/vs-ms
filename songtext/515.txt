      G                                                     Em
    Jesus Christ is coming back soon

        to call His saints home,
              C                           G
    To gather all His chosen,
                      D4—D
        all the faithful.
       G                                      Em
    He cannot delay any longer,
                                               C
        for us now, He’ll return;
                                   G        D         G
    His face we’ll see forevermore.

                                 Em
    And we’ll be singing and shouting,
                     G
        “Hallelujah!”
                               Em
    The King of love, we’ll praise
                              D
        and lift up high!
                                 Em
    All tears and sadness

        He’ll remove
                                       C                          G
        and make the shadows flee away
                     C                     G
    When we meet our Jesus
        D              G
        in the sky.
