1.    A wonderful Savior is Jesus
                 C
        my Lord,
                                  Am          Dm7-G
    A wonderful Savior to me;
             C                   C7
    He hideth my soul
                       F                 Dm7
        in the cleft of the rock,
                    C                 G                 C
    Where rivers of pleasure I see.

Chorus:
             G
    He hideth my soul
                       F                  C
        in the cleft of the rock
                 Dm7              G                   C
    That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
                                 C7
    He hideth my life
                      Dm7                  F
        in the depths of His love
                C                    G
    And covers me there
                           C
        with His hand.
                C                    G
    And covers me there
                           C
        with His hand.

2.    A wonderful Savior is Jesus
        my Lord;
    He taketh my burden away.
    He holdeth me up,
        and I shall not be moved;
    He giveth me strength as my day.

3.    With numberless blessings
        each moment He crowns
    And filled with His
        fullness divine,
    I sing in my rapture,
        oh, glory to God
    For such a Redeemer as mine!

4.    When clothed in His brightness,
        transported I rise
    To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
    His perfect salvation,
        His wonderful love,
    Iâ€™ll shout with the millions
        on high.
