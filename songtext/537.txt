               C
    My soul proclaims
                 F/C                          C
        the greatness of the Lord,
                          F
    And my spirit exults
                                C
        in God my Savior;
                                                     F/C
    For He has looked with mercy
                     C
        on my lowliness,
                            G                    G7
    And He’s shown His strength
                                         C
        with His arm almighty.

Chorus:

        great things for me,
                        G
    And His mercy will reach
                               C
        from age to age.
