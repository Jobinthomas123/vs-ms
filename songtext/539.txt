1.Who’s more important
  Am-Gm7  -C7
than Jesus?
   F G
Who could be higher
C  -Dm  -C/E
than He?
  F   G
Seated at the right hand
  Em7   -Am
of the Father,
  D7
Yet He lives inside
Dm7   —G7
of you and me.

   C  Em7
Why do we doubt
 Am  —Gm7  —C7
and often question
  F
Perfect love that
E
nailed Him to the tree?
FDm
Is there anybody who still
 C/E
loves the Lord
AmDm
With all their heart, soul, and
   G  F-C
spirit, body, mind and strength?

Chorus
   C/E FC/E
Do you really love the Master
   Dm7Gm7
more than anything?
C7  F  C/E
What will you be holding on to
   D7
when you stand before your
   G
King?
 FC/E
Why not give Him everything
 E
Within your heart
  Am
while you are here,
  F  C/E
So that nothing else will hinder
Dm7  G F-C
as He draws you ever near.

2.Tell me has your saltness
lost its savor—
Afraid that you might step
on someone’s feet?
Truth might be offensive
to the sinner,
But it’s the only thing
that’s going to set him free.

You know you are the light
within the darkness—
Hope for those who cannot
find their way.
So tell them that the Savior lives
And all the love He has to give,
And don’t forget
to point them to the Son!
