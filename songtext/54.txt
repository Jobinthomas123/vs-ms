                 D                       G
    Dear Jesus, sweet Jesus,
                       D                   G
    What a wonder You are;
                       D
    You’re brighter than
                  Bm           Em—A
        the morning star.
                     D                       G
    You’re fairer, much fairer,
                        D
    Than the lily that grows
                        G
        by the wayside,
        D                            A7
    Precious, more precious
                   D—D7
        than gold.
                                G               Em
    You are the Rose of Sharon,
               D
    The fairest of the fair,

    You are all my heart
                                 Em—A7
        could e’er desire.
                 D                       G
    Dear Jesus, sweet Jesus,
                       D                   G
    What a wonder You are;
                       D
    You’re precious,
                    A7                     D
    More precious than gold.
