1.    Father in heaven,

    May Your kingdom be established
                               Dm
        in our praises,
                           F               G
    As Your people declare
                                      C
        Your mighty works.

Chorus:

        God Almighty,
                   G                       G7       C
    Who was and is and is to come!
         G7                      C
    Blessed be the Lord,
        Em7          F         —Dm7
        God Almighty,
                 F/G          G-G7  C
    Who reigns forevermore!

2.    O God most holy, we adore You!
    We lay our all before Your throne;
    May the fragrance of Your
        presence be about us,
    As we purpose to exalt
        Your name alone.
