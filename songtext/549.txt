   E  A
For you who fear My name
   B7
The Sun of righteousness
  E
will rise
 EA
With healing in His wings,
B7  E
with healing in His wings! x2

   E  E/G#   AF#m7
And, you will skip about for joy
B7E
like calves led from the stall;
E  E/G#
And you will tread the
  AF#m7
wicked down,
 B7 E
Thus says the Lord of hosts! x2
