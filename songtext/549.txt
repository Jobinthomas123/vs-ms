               E                                  A
	For you who fear My name
               B7
	The Sun of righteousness
		          E
		will rise
	             E                            A
	With healing in His wings,
		            B7                          E
		with healing in His wings! x2

	               E              E/G#   A            F#m7
	And, you will skip about for joy
	            B7                                    E
		like calves led from the stall;
	            E              E/G#
	And you will tread the
		  A            F#m7
		wicked down,
	             B7                             E
	Thus says the Lord of hosts! x2
