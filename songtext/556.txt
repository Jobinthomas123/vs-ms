Chorus:
	     G         D          C
	Thanks be to God
		                                            D
		Who leads us in His triumph.
	      G       D           C
	Thanks be to God
		                              D      G
		Who’s got the victory. x2

	   G
1.	We have overcome the world
		  D
		by the blood of the Lamb;
	  C
	We are loving not our lives
		           D          G
		even unto death.

	The word of our testimony
	 D
	Tells the world about His love,
	C
	As we shout unto the nations
	              D            G
	He is coming back!
	                      D             G
	Oh, He is coming back!

2.	Through the blood of our Redeemer
		we are free from the curse;
	Jesus is the one and only
		perfect sacrifice.
	He has conquered Satan’s power;
	No more shall we be ashamed.
	Just as He defeated death
	We shall never die,
	No, we shall never die!
