                                        G
    We’re together again,
                                           C
        just praising the Lord.
                                        D
    We’re together again
                           G
        in one accord.

    Something good is
                            C
        going to happen;
                              G                  C
    Something good is in store.
                                         D
    We’re together again,
                                         G
        just praisin’ the Lord!
