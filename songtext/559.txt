                                   A
    My heart overflows
                    A/C#
        with a good theme;
            D               D/E      E/F#        F#m7
    I recite my verses for the King.
Bm7 Dmaj7                           E
    I bow before Your throne;
    D/E        A             A/C#
    Now I come to offer
                 D             D/E  E/F#  F#m7
        the sacrifice of wor—ship,
Bm7   Dmaj7                  Bm/E—Bm7
    O holy, righteous One!

    D/E     A
    Oh, bless the Lord,
           A/C#         C#m7  D
        bless His holy name;
           Bm7               D
    Forever I will let
                               Bm7/E – Bm7
        His praises ring.
    D/E     A
    Oh, bless the Lord,
           A/C           C#m7  D
        bless His holy  name;
          Bm7
    I worship You,
         Bm7/E      E    A
        Je—sus my King!
