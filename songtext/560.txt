1.	I look into the midnight blue
	          B/E                                      E
	And see the work You’ve done;

		     A/E
		a perfect praise
	             G                 D                 B
	While enemies hold their tongue.
	     G#m7                                C#m7
	Creation shows Your splendor,
	              G#m7                  C#m7
	Your reigning majesty;
	                    F#m7
	And Lord still I find
		                   E/G#
		that You take the time
	         A                              B
	To care for one like me.

2.	And one fine Day
		when trumpets play,
	The dead in Christ will rise;
	The chosen few will gather to
	Proclaim You Lord, Most High.
	With joyful “Hallelujahs”
	The heav’nly hosts will sing;
	Every knee shall bow,
		every tongue will shout
	That You’re the King of kings!
