1.I look into the midnight blue
  B/E  E
And see the work You’ve done;

Your children raise
 A/E
a perfect praise
 G D B
While enemies hold their tongue.
 G#m7C#m7
Creation shows Your splendor,
  G#m7  C#m7
Your reigning majesty;
F#m7
And Lord still I find
   E/G#
that You take the time
 A  B
To care for one like me.

2.And one fine Day
when trumpets play,
The dead in Christ will rise;
The chosen few will gather to
Proclaim You Lord, Most High.
With joyful “Hallelujahs”
The heav’nly hosts will sing;
Every knee shall bow,
every tongue will shout
That You’re the King of kings!
