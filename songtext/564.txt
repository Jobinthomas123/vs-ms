1.	The Lord Most High
		       Dm7               Am
		is awesome in pow’r;

	Oh yes, He is the great King
	   Dm7     E7  Am7
		o——ver all.
	                                  Dm7                   Am
	He’ll subdue the people under us
	                                 Dm7     E7   Am
	And the nations under our feet.

2.	He shall choose our portion for us—
	The excellence of Jacob
		whom He loved;
	God is gone up
with a mighty shout,
	And the Lord with
a trumpet sound.

3.	Let us sing our praises to God;
	Oh, let us sing our
		praises to our King.
	God is King of kings and Lord of
		lords;
	Sing His praise with a skillful psalm.
