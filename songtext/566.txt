             Am                       Em
1.    As David did in Jehovah’s sight,
    Am                            Em
    I will dance with all my might
          G                              Am
    Before the King of kings!
              Am
    As Miriam did with the
           Em
        tambourine,
    Am                        Em
    I will clap my hands and sing
          G                               Am
    Before the King of kings!

Chorus:
        F                           G
    We can come before Him
                    F                           Am
        and worship Him today;
       F                         G
    We can now adore Him—
         F                             Am
        Jesus made the way!

2.    As Judah did on the battle ground,
    We will make a joyful sound
    Before the King of kings!
    As Joshua did at Jericho,
    We will shout to defeat the foe
    Before the King of kings!
