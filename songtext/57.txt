    D
    He paid a debt
                              D7
        He did not owe;
                         G                             Em
    I owed a debt I could not pay.
                        D                       Bm
    I needed someone to wash
                             Em7-A
        my sins away.
                            D
    And now I sing
                                  D7
        a brand new song:
                              G
    “Amazing Grace” –
                                     Em7
        the whole day     long,
                                  D
    ‘Cause Jesus paid the debt
               Em7          A7       D
        that I could never pay.
