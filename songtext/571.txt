  G   D/F# Em7  C
1.Jesus sacrificed and gave His life
  G  — C/G
on the tree—
G
That is love!
D/F#   Em
Oh, He lived and died
   CG/B
And rose again to free us,
   C
to redeem us;
 Am7  D
Brethren, that is love.

Chorus:
  GD/F#
For God so loved the world
 Em
that He gave –
 Bm7   C
He gave and gave;
   Am7G  — C/G
He still gives today!
   G
And, the only thing
D/F#Em
He came to take away
   Bm7C
Was our sin,
  Am7   D
so we could all begin
D4  D G
To love His way.

2.Now if we can give
our lives to Him—
That is love, that is love!
Oh, we’ll live and die
And give our lives to serve Him.
Yes, we’ll serve Him;
Brethren, that is love!
