                            G
    Lift up your countenance,

    All ye saints of God;
                          Am
    Lift up your countenance,
                      D                  D7
    For the victory is won.
                            G
    Lift up your countenance,

    All ye saints of God,
                                   Am   G
    And give the glo—ry
        Am          D7  G
        to the Holy One.

                        Em
    For, the battle has been won

    Through the blood of

        God’s own Son,
                          G
    Who has walked

        from death to life;
                        Em
    And no more the gates of hell

    Will against the church prevail,
                          G                      D
    For He’s won the victory—
                     Am — D7
        eternally.
