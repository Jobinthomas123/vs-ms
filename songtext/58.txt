             D                                       A7
    Without Him I could do nothing;
                                                      D
    Without Him I’d surely fail.
              D7                                      G
    Without Him I would be drifting
                       D           A7        D
        like a ship without a sail.

    A7  D            G  D
    O Jesus, my Jesus,
                        A7
    Do you know Him today?
                               D                     D7
    Please don’t turn Him away.
           G                 D  Bm
    O Jesus, my Jesus,
              D
    Without Him
                 A7                     D
        how lost I would be.

    With Jesus I can do all things;
    With Jesus I’d never fail.
    With Jesus my ship is anchored,
    Safe and sure within the veil.
