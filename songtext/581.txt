C                           Em             Dm
    Change my heart, O God,
    G                            C   —Am
        make it ever true;
                             Em             Dm
    Change my heart, O God,
    G                              C
        may I be like You.

E                            Am
    You are the potter,
Dm   G               C  —C/D
        I am the clay;
E                                Am
    Mold me and make me,
Am 7/D                       G
        this is what I pray.
