Chorus:
                        D
    Hear my cry, O Lord,
          C            G            D
    Attend unto my prayer;

    From the end of the earth
                C        G             D
        will I cry unto Thee.
                                      A
    And, when my heart

        is overwhelmed
                   G                            D
    Please lead me to the Rock
                                          A—Em7—A
    That is higher than I,
                                          D
    That is higher than I.

  C                                 G
1.    Lord, in my distress I cried;
                    D               C         G     D
    Lift me up and make me stand.
  C                                     G
    Jesus, You’re my solid Rock;
                    A               E7            A
    Other ground is sinking sand!


2.    Come, O Lord, and fill my soul
    With a love for higher ground;
    Free my heart
        from earthly cares—
    Pressing on I’m heaven bound!

3.    Lord, I know You’re coming soon;
    You’ll sweep me up
        to see Your face.
    Help me live above this world;
    Lead me upward by Your grace!
