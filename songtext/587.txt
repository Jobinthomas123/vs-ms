1.	All throughout my life, Lord,
		   G                   A  —  A4 — A
		You have known;
	             Bm
	I can never make it
		  F#m7               Em7  — A
		trying on my own.
	                       D
	You have waited so long
		         F#m7 — Bm7
		for me;
	Em7      D/F#    G
	Only Your grace
		         Bm7      A — A4 — A
		can set me free.

Chorus:
	Em7                         A/C#
	I have come to make
		                             D—D/A—D
		a brand new start;
	                     A/G       G/A
	Lord, I’ll serve You
		                        Bm   A/C#
		with my whole heart.
	     D                             Em7
	I give my life to You now,
		D/F#       G—A
		once again;
	                     G/B
	You can make me faithful
		A/C#              D
		even to the end.

	                 D                      F#m7
2.	You can use me any way
		           G                 A—A4—A
		in which You please;
	            Bm7                 F#m7
	I will be a light to each one
		               Em7 — A
		who believes.
	                  D
	You can take me any path
		                          F#m7 — Bm7
		You wish to go;
	             Em7         D/F#
	Your face of love
		          G        Bm           A — A4 — A
		is what I want to know.
