Chorus:
	       D             —D7      G             —Em
	Through it all,   through it all,
	           A                    Em7     A
	I’ve learned to trust in Jesus;
	            D
	I’ve learned to trust in God.
	      D              —D7      G             —Em
	Through it all,   through it all,
	            A                      Em7       A4
	I’ve learned to depend upon
		   A7     D
		His Word.

	          D
1.	Now I’ve had many tears

		and sorrows,
	 Dmaj7
	I’ve had questions for tomorrow;
	     Am
	There’ve been times
		     D7                                             G
		I didn’t know right from wrong.
	              Gm
	But, in every situation
	                       D                    B7
	God gave blessed consolation
	                    Em7
	That my trials come
		     A                               D
		to only make me strong.

2.	Yes, I have lots of friends to go to
	In all the trials that I go through,
	There’ve been times
		I felt so all alone.
	But in my lonely hours,
		yes, those precious lonely hours,
	Jesus let me know that
		I’m His very own.

3.	I thank God for the mountains,
	And I thank Him for the valleys;
	I thank Him for the storms
		He brought me through.
	For if I’d never had a problem,
	I wouldn’t know that
		He could solve them;
	I’d never know what
		faith in God could do.
