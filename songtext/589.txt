                   C                    A/C#           D4 - D

2.	The angel of the Lord encamps
	‘Round those who fear His name,
	To save them and deliver them
		from harm.
	Though lions roar with hunger,
	We lack for no good thing;
	No wonder then we praise Him
		with our song.

3.	Come children, now,
		and hear me,
	If you would see the light,
	Just keep your lips from
		wickedness and lies.
	Do good and turn from evil;
	Seek peace instead of strife.
	Love righteousness and God
		will hear your cry.
