*1.* Oh, sing unto the Lord
        |E|*m*      *-*|A|
     a new song,
        |D|
   For He hath done
      |B|*m*         |E|*m-*|A|
     marvelous things.
    |D|         |D|*7*
   His right hand
              |G|   |E|*m*
     and His holy arm
         |D|                 |A|*-*|D|
   Hath gotten Him the victory.

*2.* The Lord hath made known
     His salvation;
   His righteousness
     hath He openly showed
   In the sight of the heathen.
   Oh, sing unto the Lord
     a new song.

*3.* He hath remembered His mercy
     and His truth
   Toward the house of Israel;
   All the ends of the earth have seen
   The salvation of our God.
