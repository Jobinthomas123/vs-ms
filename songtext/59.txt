              D                         Bm
1.    Oh, sing unto the Lord
            Em            -A
        a new song,
              D
    For He hath done
          Bm                Em-A
        marvelous things.
       D               D7
    His right hand
                          G     Em
        and His holy arm
                 D                                  A-D
    Hath gotten Him the victory.

2.    The Lord hath made known
        His salvation;
    His righteousness
        hath He openly showed
    In the sight of the heathen.
    Oh, sing unto the Lord
        a new song.

3.    He hath remembered His mercy
        and His truth
    Toward the house of Israel;
    All the ends of the earth have seen
    The salvation of our God.
