      D            F#m/C#  Bm         D/A
1.    Just the time I feel that I’ve
                    G                        Bm/F#  Em
    Been caught in the mire of self,
      A4                       A
    Just the time I feel my mind’s
                 A/F#               Em           D
    Been bought by worldly wealth,
                        D               F#m/C#    Bm
    That’s when the breeze begins
               D/A
        to blow;
            G                Bm/F#   Em
    I know the Spirit’s call,
              A4                             A
    And all my worldly wanderings
                D         G          A
    Just melt into His love.

Chorus:
    D            F#m/C#                         Bm
    Oh, I want to know You more,
       D/A                         G
    Deep within my soul
                            D/F#
    I want to know You.
    Em                          A
    Oh, I want to know You,
           D                    F#m/C#
    To feel Your heart
                                        Bm
    And know Your mind.
      D/A                           G
    Looking in Your eyes
                          D/F#             Em
    Stirs up within me, cries that say,
          A     A/A# Bm     D/F#
    I want to know You,
    G                             Gm
    Oh, I want to know You
          D/F#  -  E#dim
        more,
    Em                          A4      A/C# D
    Oh, I want to know You more.

2.    When my daily deeds ordinarily
    Lose life and song,
    My heart begins to bleed,
    Sensitivity to Him is gone;
    I’ve run the race, but set my pace,
    And face a shattered soul,
    But the gentle arms of Jesus
    Warm my hungering to be whole.
