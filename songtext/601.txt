                Dm                       C
1.    This race is hard to run,
                                Am
    But God has given grace
             Dm
        to overcome.
                                                            C
    You may stumble and fall down,
                          Am
    And your feet may want
               Dm
        to turn around;
                                              C
    But remember the cross,
                                     Am
        the One Who died
                              A#
    For you and all that
                                Dm
        He went through.

Chorus:
           Dm                      C
    Christ is coming soon;
                A#                                   Dm
    He’s coming for me and you,
            F                               C
    So run the race with all you have.
                  Am7
    You’re almost there,
                   C       Am     A#
        now don’t look back.
                          Dm    Am            A#
    Keep your eyes on that crown
                                       Dm/A
    And soon you’ll hear the words,
              C     Dm
        “Well done.”

2.    During this race you may feel
    That you are all alone
        and God’s not there.
    You may feel depressed and say,
    “Why Lord? Why me? Why today?”
    But, remember the blood
        that was shed
    For you on the cross of Calvary.

3.    The race is drawing to a close,
    And there are many
        who have fallen away.
    But, there are still that remain
    That have their eyes
        on the day He comes.
    So, remember you’re the bride
    That the Lord wants to receive
        to His side.
