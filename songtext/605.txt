Chorus:
                    E            B/E         A
    And I stand, I stand in awe

        of You.
          E           B/E          A
    I stand, I stand in awe of You.
                  G#
    Holy God to Whom
                 A             Adim
        all praise is due,
          F#m      B              E
    I stand in awe of You. x2

2.    You are beautiful
        beyond description,
    Yet God crushed You
        for my sin—
    In agony and deep affliction,
    Cut off that I might enter in.
    Who can grasp
        such tender compassion?
    Who can fathom
        this mercy so free?
    You are beautiful
        beyond description,
    Lamb of God Who died for me.
