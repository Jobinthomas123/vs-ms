1.    Redeemed, how I love

        to proclaim it,
             D
    Redeemed by the blood
                      G
        of the Lamb,
             G
    Redeemed through His

        infinite mercy,
                 D                              G
    His child and forever I am.

Chorus:
             C                   G
    Redeemed, redeemed,
             D
    Redeemed by the blood
                      G
        of the Lamb,
            C–Am          G-Em
    Redeemed, redeemed,
            Am/C               D          G
    His child and forever I am.

2.    Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
    No language my rapture can tell;
    I know that the light
        of His presence,
    With me doth continually dwell.

3.    I think of my blessed Redeemer;
    I think of Him all the day long.
    I sing, for I cannot be silent;
    His love is the theme of my song.

4.    I know I shall see in His beauty,
    The king in whose law I delight;
    Who lovingly guardeth
        my footsteps,
    And giveth me songs in the night.

5.    I know there’s crown that
        is waiting
    In yonder bright mansion for me;
    And soon with the spirits
        made perfect,
    At home with the Lord I shall be.
