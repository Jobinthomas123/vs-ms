  D                                A/E
1.	If I rise on the wings of the
           Bm-Bm/A
		morning
                   G                 D
	And dwell in the uttermost
          Em                 A
		parts of the sea,
 D                                    A/E
	Even there Your hand
        Bm            Bm/A
		leads me onward,
                 G
	And Your right hand’s
         D                   Em            A
		holding me unto the end.

Chorus:
G                       D
	I shall not faint
                  F#       Bm
		nor be dismayed,
               G                        D
	For You help me mount up
                    Em                A4-A
		with wings as an eagle.
 G                      D
	I shall not faint
                 F#         Bm
		nor be dismayed,
            G                D
	For until the end,  Lord,
       A                        D
		I’ll be with You.

2.	Precious are Your thoughts
		unto me, O God!
	How great is the sum of them.
	Were I to count them,
	How they would outnumber
		the grains of sand;
	When I shall awake, Lord,
		I’m still with You.
