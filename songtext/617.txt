1.Only near the cross
 F#m   C#mB/D#
Do I find joy, do I find life.
 EE/G#   A
Beneath these nail-scarred hands,
   A B/D#
It is here I feel,
 A/C#   B/D#
Only here I know:

Chorus:
G#m G#m/B C#m
No one loves me like You.
 F#m  F#m/E
You are the only one,
 DA/C#
You are the spotless lamb,
 Cdim
I wonder how could You ever
C#m
love me.
  C#m/B
Another drop of blood
   C#m/A   B/D#
falls upon my soul;
 F#mB/D#E
Only here I know â€” I love You.

2.As I sit under Your feet,
Here I feel love,
Here I find peace.
Let me lean upon Your cross;
Here I want to live,
Only here I find:
