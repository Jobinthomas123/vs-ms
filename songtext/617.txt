    E           E/G#         A
1.    Only near the cross
         F#m                   C#m        B/D#
    Do I find joy, do I find life.
             E                    E/G#               A
    Beneath these nail-scarred hands,
               A         B/D#
    It is here I feel,
                 A/C#       B/D#
    Only here I know:

Chorus:
    G#m         G#m/B                 C#m
    No one loves me like You.
                             F#m  F#m/E
    You are the only one,
                                 D            A/C#
    You are the spotless lamb,
                         Cdim
    I wonder how could You ever
                C#m
        love me.
                          C#m/B
    Another drop of blood
                       C#m/A   B/D#
        falls upon my soul;
                 F#m        B/D#                    E
    Only here I know â€” I love You.

2.    As I sit under Your feet,
    Here I feel love,
    Here I find peace.
    Let me lean upon Your cross;
    Here I want to live,
    Only here I find:
