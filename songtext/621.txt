                       D                     A/C#
    Follow Me, follow Me,
Bm                              Bm/A
    Follow where I lead you;
G                           D
    It may be a hard path,
Em7                               A
    But I’ve gone before you.
                       D                     A/C#
    Follow Me, follow Me,
Bm                       Bm/A
    And I will guide you
                    G
    Over mountains, through the
         D
        valleys;
Em7                                A
    I will always be with you.
                 D                 A/C#
    My child, My child,
Bm                             Bm/A
    I have always loved you.
G                           D
    I will never leave you,
Em7                              A
    In your time of trouble.
                               D                    A/C#
    Come with Me to Calvary;
Bm                                   Bm/A
    This is what I’ve done for you.
G                                         A
    Is My grace not sufficient
                             D
        to follow Me?
