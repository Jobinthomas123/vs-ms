           D
1. A life poured out
                        Bm7           —Dma7
		at the Master’s feet;
             D                           Bm7
	Forsaking all, His fields
                 —Dmaj7
		to reap;
              D                                G
	And if with tears we sow,
                 A                                 D
	The seeds of love will grow—
                         G            A
	We must go and give
                                   D—D7
		our lives for souls.

Chorus:
        G                   A
	We have received so much
                     D—Bm
		from Him.
                                 Em7
	How can we hold it back,
             A                       D
	Denying men of life,
                                     D7
		their souls to win?
              G                           A
	Oh, Jesus gave His life
                  D                     Bm
		as a willing sacrifice,
            G          A             D      B
	To rescue all the perishing
                              G         A              D
	From their broken lives of sin.


2.	See them grope in obscurity—
	Blindly led by empty dreams.
	But if we dare believe,
	Great glory we shall see;
	For with joy we’ll gather
		in the sheaves.

3.	Our cups are full;
		we’re satisfied.
	Our blood-stained hands
		we cannot hide;
	But Christ was crucified,
	That these may be His bride.
	Let’s arise and work before
		the night.

Last Chorus:
	We have received so much
		from Him.
	How can we hold it back,
	Denying men of life,
		their souls to win?
	Oh, we must give our lives
		as a willing sacrifice
	To rescue, now, the perishing
	From their broken lives of sin.
	Let’s rescue all,
		the great and small,
	Rememb’ring where we’ve been.
