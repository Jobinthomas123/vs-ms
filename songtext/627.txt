		oh, nothing can you do.
                                D

                                        A
		and bear much fruit
                      D          F#m
	If you abide in Me,
                    G                               A
		and My Words live in you.

		that you must draw upon;

		perfect peace within.

2.	You have not chosen Me,
		my children;
	But by My grace, I’ve chosen you.
	If you abide in Me,
		My purpose you’ll fulfill;
	Glorify Me in all you do.

3.	I leave My Holy Spirit with you,
	The Comforter, Spirit of truth;
	Obey His voice and you’ll be
		faithful to the end.
	He knows what I desire of you.
