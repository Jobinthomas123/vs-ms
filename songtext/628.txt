1.    My Jesus, I love Thee;
              Em       A             D
        I know Thou art mine.
                      G              D    Bm
    For thee all the pleasures
              Em A     D
        of sin   I resign.
                     G              Em  A
    My gracious Redeemer,
                D   G               A —A7
        my Savior art Thou;
        D  G       D             Bm
    If ever I loved Thee,
                Em-A           D
        my Jesus, ‘tis now!

2.    I love Thee because
    Thou has first loved me,
    And purchased my pardon
        on Calvary’s tree;
    I love Thee for wearing
        the thorns on Thy brow.
    If ever I loved Thee,
        my Jesus, ‘tis now!

3.    I’ll love Thee in life;
    I will love Thee in death,
    And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath.
    And say, should the death-dew
        lie cold on my brow,
    If ever I loved Thee,
        my Jesus, ‘tis now!

4.    In mansions of glory
    And endless delight,
    I’ll ever adore Thee
        in heaven so bright;
    I’ll sing with the glittering
        crown on my brow.
    If ever I loved Thee,
        my Jesus, ‘tis now!
