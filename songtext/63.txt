        |D|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.
                       |A|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.
                       |A|*7*
With a heart of thanksgiving,
                       |D|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.

With my hands lifted up,
                           |A|
And my mouth filled with praise,
                       |A|*7*
With a heart of thanksgiving,
                       |D|
I will praise Thee, O Lord.
