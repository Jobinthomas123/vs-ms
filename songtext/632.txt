 D
1.Do you know why

 a sovereign King
  Bm
Would leave His throne on high
 G F#mEm   D
To dwell here in this barren land
G A
with mortals such as I?
GA
He left His home in Paradise
   D Bm
because He loves me so,
  G
And His precious blood

has made me purer
 A—G—A
Than the virgin snow.

Chorus:
D  GA  D
Here am I, so unworthy
Bm
of the blood,
  EmA
Unworthy of the blood
  DGD
that set me free.
AD   GA  D
Oh, here am I, so unworthy
 Bm
of the blood,
   Em  A  A7 D—G/A
But yet it flowed for me.

2.That precious blood
was shed for me
To draw me to His side;
And if I serve Him faithfully,
I will with Him abide.
I don’t deserve His mercy;
He has been so good to me.
I’ll follow Him until the end
And reign eternally.
