 D
1.    Do you know why

         a sovereign King
                                                              Bm
    Would leave His throne on high
                 G             F#m        Em       D
    To dwell here in this barren land
                    G                         A
        with mortals such as I?
            G                                A
    He left His home in Paradise
               D                                 Bm
        because He loves me so,
                          G
    And His precious blood

        has made me purer
                                         A—G—A
    Than the virgin snow.

Chorus:
        D          G    A          D
    Here am I, so unworthy
                        Bm
        of the blood,
              Em                        A
    Unworthy of the blood
                  D    G    D
        that set me free.
    A        D           G    A          D
    Oh, here am I, so unworthy
                         Bm
        of the blood,
               Em      A          A7     D—G/A
    But yet it flowed for me.

2.    That precious blood
        was shed for me
    To draw me to His side;
    And if I serve Him faithfully,
        I will with Him abide.
    I don’t deserve His mercy;
        He has been so good to me.
    I’ll follow Him until the end
    And reign eternally.
