2.O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Spread His praise from
shore to shore;
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, nevermore.
How He watches
o’er His loved ones,
Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth,
Watcheth o’er them
from the throne.

3.O the deep, deep love of Jesus—
Love of every love the best.
‘Tis an ocean vast of blessing;
‘Tis a haven sweet of rest.
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
‘Tis a heaven of heavens to me;
And it lifts me up to glory,
For it lifts me up to Thee.
