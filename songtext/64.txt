       D               A7                 Bm-D7
    Turn your eyes upon Jesus;
                 G                    Em7            A-A7
    Look full in His wonderful face.
                         D              D7
    And the things of earth
                              G             Em7
    Will grow strangely dim
    Gm       D                        Em7-A
    In the light of His glory
                     D
        and grace.
