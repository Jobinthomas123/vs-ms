    D           A7                   D
    He is Lord, He is Lord,

    He is risen from the dead,
                E7       A7
    And He is Lord.
                     D                D7
    Every knee shall bow,
                  G                  Em
    Every tongue confess,
                D             A7         D
    That Jesus Christ is Lord.
