1.    When pangs of death

        seized on my soul,
           G           F     G7  C
    Unto the Lord I cried.
                                               Am
    Till Jesus came and made

        me whole,
          Dm             G7        C
    I would not be denied.

Chorus:
                                          C7
    I would not be denied.
          F                Dm       C
    I would not be denied.
                                                Am
    Till Jesus came and made

        me whole,
           Dm           G7         C
    I would not be denied.

2.    As Jacob in the days of old,
    I wrestled with the Lord;
    And instant, with a courage bold,
    I stood upon His word.

3.    Old Satan said my Lord was gone,
    And would not hear my prayâ€™r,
    But, praise the Lord!
        The work is done,
    And Christ the Lord is here.
