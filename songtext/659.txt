            Dm
    The Day of Christ shall come,
                  C                    A
    Shall come, shall come.
                Dm
    The Day of Christ shall come,
                 C                     A
    Shall come, shall come.
                 Dm
    The Day of Christ shall come,
             C                          —A
    So watch and pray
                               Dm
        for it shall come.

                  C
    Then Jesus shall descend
                  Dm
    From heaven with a shout,
                         C
    With the voice of an archangel
    Dm
    And the trump of God!

    We’ll rise together in the clouds
          Gm       A                         Dm
    Forevermore with the Lord.

                    C
    Then those dead in Christ
                       Dm
        shall arise!
                 C                                           Dm
    And we who are alive shall arise!

    Caught up together in the clouds—
          Gm      A                          Dm
    Forevermore with the Lord.
