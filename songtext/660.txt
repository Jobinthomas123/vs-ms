                            Dm
    And, lo, a Lamb stood
                               A
        upon Mt. Zion
                                    Bbmaj7
    With those that follow
                                    A
        where’er He goes.
                                    Dm
    They have the Father’s name
                                A
        upon their heads;
                                        A7
    They’ve been redeemed from
                                 Dm
        among all men.

                                     Gm
    And, they shall lift up their voices,
        Dm
    Crown Him with praises,
    Gm                     A
    Before His throne
            Dm    C/E      D/F#
        forev—er—more.
                 Gm
    They sing a new song,
            Dm
    A song of redemption,
           Gm                          A
    Redeemed by the blood
                        Dm
        of the Lamb.

                                    Dm
    And they shall follow the Lamb,
      A
    Follow the Lamb,
    Bbmaj7                              A
    Follow where’er He goes!
                                    Dm
    And they shall follow the Lamb,
      A
    Follow the Lamb,
    Bbmaj7              A      A7   Dm
    Follow where’er He goes!
