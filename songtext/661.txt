2.	Where Your people join together,
	Lord, Your Spirit fills that place;
	You are here now, Lord, forever,
	Now in Spirit,
		but one day face to face.

3.	Now we watch, Lord,
		for Your appearing,
	When the veil is torn away.
	And we see our freedom nearing;
	May this faith grow
		stronger every day.
