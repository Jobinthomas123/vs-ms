1.	Lord, give me grace
	        E
	To live this life
	  D             E                   A
	Full of doubts and fears;
	  A                             E
	Give me faith to overcome
               Bm   D               E
	My trials and my tears.

Chorus:
                            A                      E
	You said You’ll come back, Lord;
               Bm7
	I’ll wait for You.
                            A                 E
	You said You will shout, Lord;
                         Bm7
	I want to hear.
                     A                  E
	When You come back,
                               Bm7
	I want to be ready, Lord,
            F#m7          C#m     Bm7
	To meet You in the air.

2.	It’s been so long
		since I’ve known You, Lord;
	Your grace has brought
		me through.
	You’ve given me all things I need,
	To live my life for You.
