            D                                A/C#
1.	When I cry in Your presence,
	                      Am/C
	And Your love touches
		         G/B
		my heart,
	            Gm/Bb           D
	I can feel all my burdens
		                           A
		just going away. x2

Chorus:
G                          A
	You are the only one
	                        F#m7                            Bm7
	Who can change my life this way.
	                G
	I have seen Your love
	                   D/F#
	And the tears You’ve shed;
	                  Em7                     Em7/A
	I’m so glad You have brought me
	                         D
		to my first love.

2.	When I ask You, O my Lord
	To forgive me once again,
	Then I know Your blood
		washes away all my sins. x2

3.	Now I thank You
		for Your promise
	That is faithful and so true;
	How I long for Your coming
		to be with You. x2
