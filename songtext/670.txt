Chorus:
  Em
Call unto Me,
 D
And I will answer you
   C
And show you great
 D Em
And mighty things! x2

C
1.Eye has not seen
 D
nor ear has heard
C   D Em
All that I’ve prepared for you;
C
Eye has not seen
 D
nor ear has heard
C   B-B7
All that My Spirit shall do!

2.Have I not said, will I not do
All that I have promised you?
Trust in My Word; I cannot lie—
See what My power will do!

3.Ask for the rain, the latter rain;
Time has come to gather you.
I will restore the wasted years,
All of My glory renew!

4.For Zion’s sake I will not rest;
I will never hold My peace.
Till she is built in righteousness
Her glory will never cease.
