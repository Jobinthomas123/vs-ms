     Em                                          B7
    These are the days of visitation;
D                                                        Em
    These are the days of restoration.
                Am
    The Lord is sending,
             Em
        is sending the rain;
            C                   D                Em
    Behold, He is coming again.

      Am
    Send down the rain,
       Em
    Pour out Your Spirit,
       D                                        Em
    Come and revive us again;
        Am                               Em
    Make us a flame, a flame of fire,
       C                               D           Em
    Burning till You come again.
