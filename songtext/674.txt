      D           A/C#          Bm
    Jesus, draw me close,
          Em         D               A
        closer, Lord, to You;
      D             A/C#     Bm
    Let the world around me
          Em   D  A
        fade away.
      D          A/C#           Bm
    Jesus, draw me close,
          Em        D               A
        closer, Lord, to You,
               G       A                 Bm
    For my desire is to worship
         A         G-D
        and obey.
