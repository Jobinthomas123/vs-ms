    D
1.    I hear the sound
                  A
        of  abundance of  rain;
        G
    Bright clouds around
                A
        are forming.
        D
    Touch me again;
                A
        I’ll never be the same.
        G                                A  D
    Grant us fresh outpouring!

Chorus:
       D                    G    A
    Times of refreshing,
           D                   G   A
        showers of blessing—
    A                   G   A
    Open the windows
              A7            D
        of heaven wide!
      D                      G   A
    Holy Ghost power
        D                      G-A
        for this last hour—
       A                 G         D         A  D
    Lord, all Your church revive!

2.    I hear the sound of
        a rushing, mighty wind;
    Deep in my heart it’s blowing.
    Sweep o’er my soul
        and change my life within.
    Fill us to overflowing!

3.    I hear the voice
        of my Savior calling me:
    My child, for you I’m coming;
    What I’ve begun
I promise to complete—
    First love and faith restoring!
