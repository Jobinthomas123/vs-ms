    A                     F#m7
    Shut in with God
                     D           E
        in the secret place,
         E7
    There in the Spirit
               D   E        E7  A
        beholding His face.
       A                       D
    Gaining new power
            C#m                 F#m7
        to run in lifeâ€™s race,
        E                    E7
    I long to be shut in
                   A
        with God.
