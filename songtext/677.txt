        Lord my God,
           F                 G
    Among the gods,
                      C              -G
        who is like You?
         C                  G
    Glorious in holiness,
       F                        C
    Fearful in all praises,
                 F                      G
    And doing great wonders,
        G                      G7  C
    Doing great wonders!

1.    The Lord is my strength
                      F                       C
        and become my salvation;
               F                 G
    Oh, He is my God.
                    C               -G
    I will exalt Him!
                C                G
    The Lord is a man of war,
       F                  C
    Mighty in power;
             F                              G
    His right hand will crush
    F             G       C
    All my enemies!

2.    The army of Pharoah,
        the chariots and horses,
    Were cast in the sea—
        what a victory!
    We’ll dance and rejoice in Him,
    Shout hallelujah!
    We have been set free—
        glorious liberty!

3.    The enemy comes
        to devour Your people,
    But You stretch Your hand
        out to destroy him!
    Your greatness and majesty
    Scatter his forces;
    You reign, O Most High,
        now and evermore!
