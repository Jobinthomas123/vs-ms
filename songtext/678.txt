           E                                            B
1.	In tenderness He sought me,
                                                E
	Weary and sick with sin.

	And on His shoulders
             A
		brought me
                 B           F#7      B
	Back to His fold again,
                  B7         E
	While angels in His
           B              E
		presence sang,
           F#                             B     F#   B-B7
	Until the courts of heaven rang.

Chorus:
	E                                                  B
	Oh, the love that sought me!
	B7                                                   E
	Oh, the blood that bought me!
                                              B
	Oh, the grace that brought me
         E          B
		to the fold,
         E                   A                   E
	Wondrous grace that brought me
        B          E
		to the fold!

2.	He washed the bleeding
		sin-wounds
	And poured in oil and wine;
	He whispered to assure me,
	“I’ve found thee, thou art Mine”.
	I never heard a sweeter voice;
	It made my aching heart rejoice!

3.	He pointed to the nail-prints,
	For me His blood was shed.
	A mocking crown so thorny,
	Was placed upon His head;
	I wondered what He saw in me,
	To suffer such deep agony.

4.	I’m sitting in His presence,
	The sunshine of His face,
	While with adoring wonder
	His blessings I retrace.
	It seems as if eternal days
	Are far too short
		to sound His praise.

5.	So, while the hours are passing,
	All now is perfect rest;
	I’m waiting for the morning,
	The brightest and the best,
	When He will call us to His side,
	To be with Him,
		His spotless bride.
