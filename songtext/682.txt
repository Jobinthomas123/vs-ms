                C              Am        C
	His mighty Word renews
                G7
		my youth.
              C              C7
	By His own power,
                    F                 Dm
		from sickness free,
	            C              Am         C G        C
	My precious Savior healeth me.

Chorus:
             C             G
	He healeth me.
                 F             C
		He healeth me.
        F    C                Am
	By His own Word
                 C            G7
		He healeth me;
              C             G7         F                 C
	His faithful witness I would be,
	  F      C             Am
	For by His Word
                  C G       C
		He healeth me.

2.	Sometimes through testing
		times I go,
	Dark seems the way,
		and full of woe;
	But in the furnace though I be,
	My great Physician healeth me.

3.	Lord, I would spread this
		truth abroad—
	The mighty power of Thy Word;
	It’s just the same,
		the blind now see,
	And demons at Thy presence flee.

4.	For sin and sickness doth depart,
	When Thou dost reign
		within the heart;
	And I from all the curse am free,
	Since Christ, my Savior,
		healeth me.
