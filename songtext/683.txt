      G            C                       G
1.	Face to face with Christ
                Am-D7
		my Savior,
      D                                              G
	Face to face what will it be?
                              C
	When with rapture
       G       Am     C
		I behold Him,
     Am           G                D7            G
	Jesus Christ who died for me.

Chorus:
       D7                                 G
	Face to face shall I behold Him,
	  D         A                 A7         D-D7
	Far beyond the starry sky;
	  G           G7                           C-Am
	Face to face in all His glory,
                   G                   D7      G
	I shall see Him by and by!

2.	Only faintly now I see Him,
	With the darkling veil between.
	But a blessed day is coming
	When His glory shall be seen.

3.	What rejoicing in His presence,
	When are banished grief and pain,
	When the crooked ways
are straightened
	And the dark things shall be plain.

4.	Face to face—O blissful moment!
	Face to face—to see and know!
	Face to face with my Redeemer,
	Jesus Christ Who loves me so.
