    Am  F            Dm                   G     C
1. O sacred head, now wounded,
        E     Am                E7
    With grief and shame
                            Am
        weighed down,
                   F        Dm           G     C
    Now scornfully surrounded
        E    Am               E7       Am
    With thorns Thy only crown.
               G                  F
    How art Thou pale with
         C4   C
        anguish,
                 F         Dm               A
    With sore abuse and scorn!
       D7     G                C          D      G
    How does that visage languish
           C     F                   G                C
    Which once was bright as morn!

2.    What Thou, my Lord, hast
        suffered
    Was all for sinner’s gain;
    Mine, mine was the transgression,
    But Thine the deadly pain.
    Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
    ‘Tis I deserve Thy place.
    Look on me with Thy favor;
    Entrust me to Thy grace.

3.    What language shall I borrow
    To thank Thee, dearest Friend,
    For this Thy dying sorrow,
    Thy pity without end?
    O make me Thine forever;
    And should I fainting be,
    Lord, let me never, never
    Outlive my love for Thee!
