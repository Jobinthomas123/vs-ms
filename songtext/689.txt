Chorus:
	D                               G                    A
	And, you shall search for Me,
	                              D             Bm
	And you shall find Me
	                                   Em                   A
	When you shall search for Me
	           A7
	With all your heart and soul. x2

	A                            D4
1.	Come, let us return
		               D
		to the Lord,
  A
	And turn from our
		  D4           D
		wicked ways;

  G                               D
	For He will forgive our sins
  A                                            D
	And restore us once again. x2

2.	Come, let us seek our God,
	While He may yet be found,

	And call on His holy name,
	While His presence is still near. x2
