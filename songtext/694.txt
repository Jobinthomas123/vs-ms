1.More love to Thee, O Christ,
 G  Am7-D
more love to Thee!

Hear Thou the prayer I make
AmC/D D  G
on  bended knee;
 C   G
This is my earnest plea:
   D   Am  G
more love, O Christ, to Thee.
CG
More love to Thee,
 Am7 D   G
more love to Thee!

2.Once earthly joy I craved,
sought peace and rest.
Now Thee alone I seek;
give what is best.
This all my prayer shall be:
more love, O Christ to Thee.
More love to Thee,
more love to Thee!

3.Let sorrow do its work;
send grief and pain.
Sweet are Thy messengers;
sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me,
more love, O Christ to Thee,
More love to Thee,
more love to Thee!

4.Then shall my latest breath
whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry
my heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be:
more love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
more love to Thee!
