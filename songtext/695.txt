                   C                  C7
1.    When peace like a river
           Dm   G              C
        attendeth my way,
                  Am                   D7
    When sorrows like sea
                        G – G7
      billows roll,
              C              F
    Whatever my lot, Thou hast
          D7                    G
        taught me to say,
    F       C/E             C/G
    It is well, it is well
           G             C
        with my soul.

Chorus:
               G
    It is well (it is well)
                                                      C
    With my soul (with my soul).
                F               C/G
    It is well, it is well
          G              C
        with my soul.

2.    Though Satan should buffet,
        tho’ trials should come,
    Let this blest assurance control,
    That Christ has regarded my
        helpless estate,
    And hath shed His own
        blood for my soul.

3.    My sin, oh, the bliss of this
        glorious tho’t—
    My sin, not in part, but the whole
    Is nailed to the cross and I
        bear it no more.
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
        O my soul!

4.    And, Lord, haste the day when
        my faith shall be sight,
    The clouds be roll’d back
        as a scroll.
    The trump shall resound,
        and the Lord shall descend,
    Even so, it is well with my soul.
