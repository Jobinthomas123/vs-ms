          D
1.    When I survey
        A-B   Em    A7       D
        the wondrous cross,
                                    D4      D     Bm     A
    On which the Prince of glory died,
    D                           A-B Em      A7    D
    My richest gain I count but loss,
      Bm                     F#m
    And pour contempt
        Bm   Em   A7       D
        on   all   my pride.

2.    Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
    Save in the death of Christ
        my God;
    All the vain things that charm
        me most,
    I sacrifice them to His blood.

3.    See, from His head,
        His hands, His feet,
    Sorrow and love flow
        mingled down.
    Did eâ€™er such love
        and sorrow meet,
    Or thorns compose so rich
        a crown?

4.    Were the whole realm of
        nature mine,
    That were a present far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my soul, my life, my all.
