1.	My heart  was distressed ‘neath

		Jehovah’s dread frown.
	            F                    C
	And, low in the pit where my
		  G                               G7
		sins dragged me down
	      C
	I cried to the Lord from the
		   F       C/E      Dm
		deep miry clay,
	            C
	Who tenderly brought me
		 D7        G    G7    C
		out to golden day.

Chorus:
	C                            F/C                 C
	He brought me out of the miry  clay;
	Am                                        G      D  G-G7
	He set my feet on the Rock to stay.
	  C                  C7                 F             Dm
	He puts a song in my soul today—
	       C               Am               G-G7-C
	A song of praise, hallelujah!

2.	He placed me upon the
		strong Rock by His side;
	My steps were established,
		and here I’ll abide.
	No danger of falling
while here I remain,
	But stand by His grace
		until the crown I gain.

3.	He gave me a song;
		‘twas a new song of praise.
	By day and by night
		its sweet notes I will raise.
	My heart’s overflowing;
		I’m happy and free.
	I’ll praise my Redeemer,
		Who has rescued me.

4.	I’ll sing of His wonderful
		mercy to me;
	I’ll praise Him till all men
		His goodness shall see.
	I’ll sing of salvation
		at home and abroad,
	Till many shall hear the
		truth and trust in God.

5.	I’ll tell of the pit,
		with its gloom and despair;
	I’ll praise the dear Father
		Who answered my prayer.
	I’ll sing my new song,
		the glad story of love,
	Then join in the chorus
		with the saints above.
