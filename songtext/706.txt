    Lord, prepare me
                                    A
        to be a sanctuary—
                        G—Em                    D—A
    Pure and ho—ly, tried and true.
        A7                  D                           A
    With thanksgiving, I’ll be a living
                  G—A          D
    Sanctuary    for You.
