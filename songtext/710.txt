1.    All heaven declares
                   D                   C         G
        the glory of the risen Lord.

    Who can compare
                                        C            G

              G/D                        C    —C/D
    I’ll gladly bow the knee,
                 D7          D/F#     G
    And worship Him alone.

2.    I will proclaim
        the glory of the risen Lord,
    Who once was slain
        to reconcile man to God.
    Forever You will be
    The Lamb upon the throne;
    I’ll gladly bow the knee,
    And worship You alone.
