       Dm                                       A
    O Jesus, I now hear Thy voice

        calling me
             Gm              A
    To forsake my all,
        Dm
        and follow Thee;
           Gm                           C
    To go where Thou sendest,
              F                Dm
        to labor for Thee—
         Gm—A            Dm
    O Lord… send me!

                           Bb                   Gm
    And I will rise up and follow,
          A                   Dm
        follow the Lamb.
                Gm                  C
    I will do all Thy will
                          Dm            D7/F#
        and give all that I am.
               Gm                    C
    My heart’s one desire,
                    F                Dm
        Thy servant to be,
         Gm—A            Dm
    O Lord… send me!
