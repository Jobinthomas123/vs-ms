1.    Jesus! What a Friend for sinners!
      D              Bm    Em7  A      D
    Jesus—Lover of   my soul.
      D                     Bm
    Friends may fail me,
         Em        A
        foes assail me.
     D              Bm           Em7   A        D
    He, my Savior, makes me whole.

Chorus:
     D        Bm         Em         A7
    Hallelujah! What a Savior!
     D        Bm         Em7         A
    Hallelujah! What a Friend!
      D            Em7           D              A7
    Saving, helping, keeping, loving—
      D         G     Em   D    A    D
    He is with me   to the end.

2.    Jesus! What a strength in weakness!
    Let me hide myself  in  Him.
    Tempted, tried, and
        sometimes failing,
    He, my strength, my vict’ry wins.

3.    Jesus! What a help in sorrow
    While the billows o’er me roll.
    Even when my heart is breaking,
    He, my comfort, helps my soul.

4.    Jesus! What a Guide and Keeper
    While the tempest still is high.
    Storms about me,
        night o’ertakes me,
    He, my Pilot, hears my cry.

5.    Jesus! I do now receive Him,
    More than all in Him I find;
    He hath granted me forgiveness;
    I am His, and He is mine.
