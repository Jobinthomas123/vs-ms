        G                             C Am
    This is my rest forever;
       G    Em            Am-D7
    Here will I dwell.
                      G                                 C-Am
    For the Lord hath chosen Zion,
                           G
    He hath desired it
                   D7             G
        for His habitation.
                    C
    I will abundantly bless
                              G
        her provision,
                  A7
    I will satisfy her poor
                     D7
        with bread,
                   G
    I will clothe her priests
                         C  Am
        with salvation,
                         G                              D7
    And her saints will shout aloud
              G
        for joy.
