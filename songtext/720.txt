1.Floods of revival,
   F C
Lord, let them fall—
 Am-G
Streams of salvation
D7G
reaching to all.
C
Pour out Thy Spirit;
FC
great is our need.
 F—Dm
Sweep o’er our beings,
  GC
now while we plead.

Chorus:
  C  FC
Spirit divine, O quicken us now,
F—Dm
While in Thy presence,
D7 G
humbly we bow.
C F
Set all our hearts ablaze
C
with Thy love;
   F—Dm
Teach us the secret of
 G   C
life from above.

2.Utterly yielded, longing to know
All the blest fullness
love can bestow,
Ready and willing, eager to give
Perfect obedience, bravely to live.

3.Raise up a people, holy and free—
Hearts with a vision
like unto Thee,
Souls that would rather
die than give in—
Lives with a passion,
victory to win.

4.O for a deluge—
Holy Ghost power;
Lord, we are waiting,
send it this hour.
Open the windows
of heav’n we pray;
All on the altar
gladly we lay.
