		every blessing,
	                     F              G                  C
	Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
	        C                            C/E        G
	Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
	                  F                G               C
	Call for songs of loudest praise.
	                                     F/C                    C
	Teach me some melodious sonnet,
	                                      F/C            C
	Sung by flaming tongues above;
	     G                C
	Praise the mount—
		                        G
		I’m fixed upon it,
	                         F        G              C
	Mount of Thy redeeming love.

2.	Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
	Hither by Thy help I’m come.
	And I hope by Thy good pleasure,
	Safely to arrive at home.
	Jesus sought me when a stranger,
	Wandering from the fold of God;
	He, to rescue me from danger,
	Interposed His precious blood.

3.	O to grace how great a debtor,
	Daily I’m constrained to be!
	Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
	Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
	Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
	Prone to leave the God I love.
	Here’s my heart,
		O take and seal it;
	Seal it for Thy courts above.
