1.    Some glad morning

        when this life is o’er,
      A              E
    I’ll fly away;
                                  C#m7
    To a home on God’s

        celestial shore,
F#m7—B        E
    I’ll fly away.

Chorus:
     E                                E7
    I’ll fly away, O glory;
     A               E
    I’ll fly away.
                                    C#m7
    When I die, hallelujah, by and by,
F#m7 – B       E
    I’ll fly away.

2.    When the shadows
        of this life have gone,
    I’ll fly away;
    Like a bird from
        prison bars has flown,
    I’ll fly away.

3.    Just a few more
        weary days and then
    I’ll fly away;
    To a land where
        joys shall never end,
    I’ll fly away.
