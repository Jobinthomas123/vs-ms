	     C                           Am7
1.	I hear the Savior say,
		                G                                   C
		“Thy strength indeed is small!
	                     C
	Child of weakness,
		                      Am
		watch and pray,
		             Dm7           G         C
	Find in Me thine all in all.”

Chorus:
	C                       F
	Jesus paid it all,
		C        Am7      Dm7—G
		all to Him I owe;
	 C                          Am7          F
	Sin has left a crimson stain—
	          C                   G              C
	He washed it white as snow.

2.	For nothing good have I whereby
		Thy grace to claim;
	I will wash my garments white in
		the blood of Calvary’s Lamb.

3.	And when before the throne I
		stand in Him complete,
	“Jesus died my soul to save,”
		my lips shall still repeat.
