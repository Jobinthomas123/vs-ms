     D            G/E                        A
1.	There’s a land of pure repose
	                           D               A/C#        Bm
	Where we’ll rest from all our foes,
	               Em7                         A
	In the place prepared above
	A/C#        D                         D7
	By our Savior in His love.
	                          G/E                      A
	There we’ll gaze upon the face
	                             D
	Of Him Who saved us
		A/C#         Bm
		by His grace
	                               Em7                        A
	And worship Him Who set us free
		                  D
		on Calvary.

Chorus:
          D7                       G
	Though here the road be
		                         A/G
		rough and steep,
	                        D
	And bitter trials
		            A/C#           Bm
		may make us weep.
	                            Em7                        A
	With broken heart and spirit faint,
	       A/C#  D                                D7
	Yet our lips bear no complaint.
	                    G                                  A/G
	For we know our suff’rings here
	                   D                 A/C#    Bm
	Work a weight of glory there,
	               Em7                                    A
	In our home where we shall rest
		         A/C#       D
		on Jesus’ breast.

2.	In that land of perfect peace
	Where our restless strivings cease
	We shall know
		as now we’re known,
	We shall share our
		Savior’s throne.
	God Himself shall wipe our tears,
	His perfect love dispel our fears,
	And former things shall pass away
		in perfect day.

3.	See that city, bright and fair,
	Like a jasper, pure and rare;
	Christ’s great treasure
		is His bride,
	Whom He loved
		for whom He died.
	See her twelve foundations strong—
	Each formed of precious
		stones so long
	Hard pressed and shaped,
		but now so bright
		in heaven’s light.

4.	Gates of glory fill our view,
	Each a pearl, whose milky hue
	Speaks of long and sore travail,
	Borne by saints within the veil.
	See her streets all paved
		with gold—
	The tale of faith triumphant told.
	O! New Jerusalem,
		my own sweet heav’nly home.
