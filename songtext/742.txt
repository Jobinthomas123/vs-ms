1.	When I think of what You’ve
		                  Em   —G
		done for me,
	   A                  D
	How do I thank You, Lord.

	When I think of how You
	                    Em  —G
		set me free,
	           A                         G
	No words can describe just
		  A                  D
		how I feel now.

Chorus:
	G/A    A     D
	Lord, I thank You for
		  D/F#              Em—G
		saving my soul;
	         Em                 A
	My sadness is gone, and my
		   A7                                D
		heart’s filled with praise.
	G/A    A    D

		sending Your Son
	        Em                       A
	To take away my sins
		           A7             D
		and carry my load.
	                                     G
	For all You have done,
		            A                 Bm
		what can I do, Lord?

	For all You have done,
		            A                 D
		what can I do, Lord?

2.	When I think of how You’ve
		brought me through,
	I give all the praise to You.
	When I think of all Your
		love for me,
	I want to live forever
		with my Lord.
