1.	Though the fig tree shall not
		    G
		blossom
	                    F                                  C
	And the vine shall bear no fruit,
	                                                G
	Though the labor of the olive fail,
	          F                                       C
	The fields shall yield no food,
	                         Dm7
	Though the flock be cut off
		   G
		from the fold,
	             F                                C
	The stalls be void and cold,
	                 Dm7—G               C
	I will rejoice;   I will rejoice.

Chorus:
	C7            F                       G/F
	I will rejoice in the Lord;
	       Em7                                Am
	He is my strength and song.
	                 F                      G/F
	I will rejoice in the Lord;
	          Em7                                         Am
	He makes my weak hands strong.
	                 F                       F/G
	I will rejoice in my God;
	             C                          Am
	He’s Lord of all creation.
	              Dm7
	I will joy in the
		   G         G7           C
		God of my salvation.

2.	Though my heart be cold and
		empty
	And my soul downcast within,
	Though my strength be lost,
		and sickness
	Eat away my bones and skin,
	Though my hands hang down,
	My spirit fail
		within my frame so frail,
	I will rejoice; I will rejoice.

3.	Though I stand alone on
		barren ground
	And all forsake my side,
	Though the only friends who
		understand
	Must far from me abide;
	Though the ones I loved,
		who share my bread,
	From me have turned and fled,
	I will rejoice; I will rejoice.

4.	For the Lord, He is my Savior;
	Yes, the Lord, He is my stay.
	He will make my feet
		like hind’s feet,
	O’er the dangers on the way;
	He will place my feet
		on higher ground,
	Then will this theme resound:
	“I will rejoice; I will rejoice.”
