 |A|     |D|                 |B|*m*
Not my will but Thine be done,
          |A|
That the fullness of the Son
     |B|*7*
May dwell within this life
            |E|        |E|*7*
That I have offered Thee.
      |D|           |B|*m*
Until everything I do
              |A|
Becomes the thing
               |F#|*m*
 that pleases You,
      |A|              |E|
Abba Father, I would be
            |A|
 Thy son indeed.
