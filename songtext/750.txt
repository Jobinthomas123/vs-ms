Chorus:
	                  Dm                Gm              Dm
	For His grace is sufficient for me,

	And His presence will meet
		              A
		every need;
	        Gm                     Dm
	For by His power I will overcome.
	                     Bb                A                Dm
	Yes, His grace is sufficient for me.

	             Dm                         Gm
1.	And though the battle rage
		         Dm
		all around me,
	                                                              A
	And there be fears within, without,
	          Gm                                  Dm
	His Spirit will surely uphold me;
	       Bb      A                                  Dm
	I’ll overcome all fear and doubt.

2.	And when the enemy comes
		against me,
	And clouds and darkness
		fill my view,
	The Lord will surely deliver me;
	His power and love
		will see me through.

3.	Though all the ones I love
		may forsake me,
	And there be none to lend
		their hand,
	The Lord will surely be near me,
	And by His grace I shall stand.

4.	For God will perfect that which
		concerns me;
	All that He’s promised He’ll do.
	The Lord will surely complete
		in me
	The work that He started to do.
