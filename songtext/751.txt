Em                                       B7
	Not by might, not by power,
	                                                Em
	But by the Spirit of the Lord. x2

	   Am                                                 Em
	Come, O Lord with mighty power;
	          B7                                     Em  E
	Descend with tongues of fire.
	      Am                                      Em
	Deliver me from all my enemies;
	                   B7                Em
	I want to live in victory.

	  Am             Em

	Revive and set my spirit free;
	 Am                             Em
	Make me an overcomer—
	                             B7                 Em
	With You to reign eternally.
