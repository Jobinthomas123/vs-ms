Em
    It’s not by power,
  Am
        it’s not by might,
            C                D                          Em
    But by my Spirit, says the Lord!

    Not with Your wisdom
        Am
        shall you now fight,
            C                D                          Em
    But by My Spirit, says the Lord!

                      Am
    For the Lord goes before you
                Em
        as a man of war,
               B
    Destroying every foe,
                  Em                 E
        your victory is sure!
               Am
    Be strong, and take courage,
    Em
        and fear no more,
                     C               D
    For it’s by My Spirit,
                            Em
        says the Lord!
