    O Lord,
                                        F#m-Bm
        Your steadfast love
    Bm7/A             A/G-G-G/A
    And tender mercy   have been
                 Em/D-D

      D                       Gmaj7 -  A
    For by Your hand
          A2/G                 F#m7-Bm7
        we have been fed,
    Em7/A                    A/G-G   -G/A
    And by Your Spi—rit
                                     A/B-G/A
        we have been led.

2.    O Lord, Almighty God,
    Father, unchanging,
        upright and holy.
    O Lord, You have been true;
    You have been faithful,
        You have been good.
