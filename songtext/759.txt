1.    My child,
                 Am                     Dm
        My eyes are ever on you;
                    G                 G7
    When you’re distressed
                                       C
        you know I’m near.
                                      —C7
    Why do you fret?
                                   F
        Why do you fear?
                D                                    G
    My grace will see you through.

Chorus:
    C G     F                                C
    I am near as I am that I am;
Am        Dm                  G
    I am near, each moment
                          C    —C7
        by your side.
        C     G    F
    Trust in Me
                                                  C
        and in My presence hide;
Am             Dm
    Rest in Me,
                   F/G    G           C
        for—ev—er be Mine.

2.    When you’re despised
        and feel forsaken,
    Rejoice! A crown awaits on high.
    Lift up your eyes;
        redemption’s nigh.
    Behold, you are My bride.

3.    Your prayers, it seems,
        I do not answer;
    Have faith! In Me there’s no defeat.
    What I began I will complete;
    My glory you will see.

4.    In your affliction I’m afflicted;
    Your pain and sorrow I do share.
    As I the cross did gladly bear,
    Oh, follow in my steps!

5.    Rise up, array yourself with glory;
    My pow’r confess,
        My word proclaim.
    In joy or pain, honor My name—
    My promise shall not fail!
