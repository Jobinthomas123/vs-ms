 My heart is thrilled
      |D|*m7*              |F| |C|
  wheneâ€™er I think of Jesus,
               |G|*7*
 That blessed name
                           |C|
  that sets the captives free.
            |F|
 The only name through which
                |C|
  I find salvation,
          |G|*7*
 No other name has meant
              |C|
  so much to me.
