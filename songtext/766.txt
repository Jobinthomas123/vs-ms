2.On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened deep and wide;
Thru the floodgates of
God’s mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above;
Heaven’s peace and
perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.

3.Let me all Thy love accepting,
Love Thee, ever all my days;
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
And my life be to Thy praise.
Thou alone shalt be my glory;
Nothing in the world I see.
Thou hast cleansed
and sanctified me;
Thou Thyself hast set me free.

4.In Thy truth
Thou doest direct me,
By Thy Spirit
through Thy Word;
And Thy grace
my need is meeting,
As I trust  in Thee, my Lord.
All Thy fullness Thou art pouring
In Thy love and pow’r in me,
Without measure,
full and boundless,
As I yield myself to Thee.
