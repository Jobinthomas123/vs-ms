    Search my heart, O Lord, I pray,

    And see if there be
               Dm                        G
    Any wicked way in me
             C                 C7
    That I cannot see.

    Cleanse me thoroughly from all
                      Em
        my sin.
                              Am                     Am7
    Sanctify my heart within.
                               Dm                      G
    Lord, please wash my sins away,

    And lead me in Your perfect way.

    Search my heart, O Lord, today,
              C
        I pray.
