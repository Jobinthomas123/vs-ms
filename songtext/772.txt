Chorus:
      E      G#m      A                                  E
    Oh, Lord, I come before You now,
              A                       E/G#
    To worship You, adore You,
                   F#          B
        to praise You.
      E    G#m    A                       E
    Oh, Lord,  I surrender now;
               A
    With all my heart,
               B                              C#m    G#m
        I bow before Your throne.
         F#m                 B                           E
    I dedicate my life to be Your own.

               G#m              C#m
1.    My heart was so far from You;
         F#m                             B
    I couldn’t find You, Lord.
        G#m             C#m
    I felt so unworthy, I thought,
         F#m                                B7
    “How could You love me?”

2.    There were so many questions
    That were troubling my mind;
    With all the doubts inside of me,
    Your way I could not find.

3.    Then You came and showed me
    All the love You have for me.
    In gratitude I honor You;
    I’ll do Your will, my King.
