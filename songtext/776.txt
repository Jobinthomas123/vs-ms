D                             F#m
	Teach me, O Lord,
		           G                     A
		the way of Your statutes;
D                                 F#m
	Give me understanding,
		        G                                 A
		and I will keep Your law.
G                      A
	Direct me in the path of
		 D    A/C#    Bm
		Your commands.
Em                        A
	Incline my heart to
		                  D      Am7    D7
		Your decrees.
G                                 A
	Turn away my eyes from
		       D        A/C#   Bm
		beholding vanity,
	                          Em   A               D
	And quicken me  in Your way.
