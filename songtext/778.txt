                                                        B7
    We need Your fire in our souls!

        quicken us today.
                  E          B7           E
    Holy Spirit, take control!

Chorus:

    Lord, we need Your fire.
                                             C#m
    How we need Your fire
             F#m   B7
        in our souls!
                         E      E7               A       F#m
    Let Your fire burn, holy fire burn,
                      E                 B7
    For we need Your fire
                      E
        in our souls!

2.    And in the midst of every trial,
    We need Your fire in our souls!
    Overcoming power,
        every day and hour,
    To defeat our every foe!

3.    And till You come in glory,
    We need Your fire in our souls!
    When that trumpet sounds
        weâ€™ll be glory bound.
    Oh, what joy, as never known!
