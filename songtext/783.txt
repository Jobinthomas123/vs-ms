Chorus:
          D                          D7
    Come fellowship
                                        G       Em
        with Me in My sufferings;
                  A4                        A7
    Come drink with Me
                              G    A                D
        the cup of ridicule and shame.
                                            D7
    Come walk with Me
                                G        Em
        the road to Calvary.
                            D                      Bm
    Don’t be afraid My child;
           Em   A                 D    D4
        love paves the way.

                   D
1. I have led you beside
                          Em     A
        the still waters.
                  Em
    I have led you where
             A      A7             D     D4
         green pastures grow,
                      D                     D7
    But I’m calling you now
                                  G       Em
         to something deeper,
                    D                        A7
    So the depths of My love
                                 D
        you may know.

2.    You have tasted the glories
        of heaven.
    You have leaped over walls
        run through troops;
    But I’m calling you now
        to something higher,
    If the heights of My love
        you will prove.

3.    We have met, lingered long
        in sweet communion.
    We have shared all our joys
        and our pains;
    But My love for you, child,
        it passes knowledge.
    If you’re willing, this love
        you can gain.

4.    Can you not hear My voice
        gently calling.
    For My love, yes,
        My dove undefiled?
    Don’t delay, come away
        with me, beloved.
    If you follow Me now,
        you’ll be My bride.
