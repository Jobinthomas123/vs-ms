1.	I was sinking deep in sin,
		                                     D7
		sinking to rise no more;
	  Am                              D
	Overwhelmed by guilt within,
		Am            D          G         D7
		mercy I did implore.
	G
	Then the Master of the sea
		                                            C Am7
		heard my despairing cry.
	      C              Cm       G
	Christ my Savior lifted me;
	  	  C       D    D7  G  D
		now safe am  I.

Chorus:
       G       D        G  C
	Love lifted me!
		G                       C  E7 Am
	Love lifted me!
     C                           D7
	When no one but
		   G
		Christ could help,
       A       (D7)     D7 (G)
	Love lifted me! x2

2.	Souls in danger, look above,
		Jesus completely saves;
	He will lift you by His love
		out of the angry waves.
	Heâ€™s the Master of the sea;
		billows His will obey.
	He your Savior wants to be,
		be saved today!

3.	When the waves of sorrow roll,
		when I am in distress,
	Jesus takes my hand in His,
		ever He loves to bless.
	He will every fear dispel,
		satisfy every need;
	All who heed His loving call,
		find rest indeed.
