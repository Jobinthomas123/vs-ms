  C  F  Dm
1.A friend of Jesus, oh, what bliss
   CDG
That one so weak as I
 CFDm
Should ever have a friend like this
CG7 C
To lead me to the sky.

Chorus:
FDmC
Friendship with Jesus,
F C D7-G G7
Fellowship divine;
 C C7
Oh, what blessed
 FDm
sweet communion—
CD7G  G7   C
Jesus is a friend of mine.

2.A friend when other
friendships cease,
A friend when others fail,
A friend who gives me
joy and peace,
A friend who will prevail.

3.A friend to lead me in the dark,
A friend who knows the way,
A friend to steer my
weak, frail bark,
A friend my debts to pay.

4.A friend when sickness
lays me low,
A friend when death draws near,
A friend as through the vale I go,
A friend to help and cheer.

5.A friend when life’s rough
voyage is o’er,
A friend when death is past,
A friend to greet on
heaven’s shore,
A friend when home at last.
