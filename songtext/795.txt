   C-Dm-C
1.O, mighty cross—
Em - Am
Love lifted high,
  Dm
The Lord of life
Dm/C  G4 - G
Raised there to die.

Chorus:
G/E   FG  Em - Am
His sacrifice   on Calvary
  Dm  C/E
Has made the mighty cross
 FG   C
A tree of life to me.

2.O, mighty cross—
What throne of grace!
He knew no sin,
Yet took my place.

3.O mighty cross,
O Christ so pure—
Love held Him there,
Such shame endured.

4.O, mighty cross—
My soul’s release!
The stripes He bore
Have brought me peace.
