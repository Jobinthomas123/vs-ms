    C                           F                  C
1.    Daily I would walk with Jesus
    Am                         C
    Through this world of
                            G
        sin and strife,
    C                            F        C
    Living in His holy presence
                                   G          C
    Every moment of my life.

Chorus:
        F             G           Em-Am
    O Jesus, blessed Savior!
    F           G         C
    Lover of my soul!
          F               G        Em-Am
    Abide with me forever,
                G                  G7       C
    And make me Thine alone.

2.    Daily I would hear Thee speaking
    Through the tempting
        sound and snares.
    Guide me on to glorious victâ€™ry,
    That I might Thy glory share.

3.    Daily I would see Thy beauty
    Through the trials and
        tests of life,
    Changing me to thine own image
    Perfected, no more to strive.
