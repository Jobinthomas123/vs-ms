  I must have Jesus
   |G|        |D|
    in my whole life;
               |D|    |B|*m*     |E|*m7â€“*|A|*7*
  I must have Jesus in my life.
         |D|              |D|*7*
  In my walking, in my talking,
           |G|             |E|*m7*
  In my sleeping, in my waking,
          |D|       |A|*7*     |D|
  I must have Him in my life.
