    O let the beauty of Thy holiness
                G                A          Bm
    Dear Lord, be seen in me;
             A    F#           Bm              E7
    Thy purity, humility and grace
                                           A7
        flow out through me.

    Thy meekness, peace

        and joy and love,
          G           A        F#         Bm
    O Holy Spirit, gentle Dove,
            G               A            D          D7
    Descend, restore, renew, refine,
         G                      A        G   D
    Create in me a life divine.

2.    Sanctify my spirit, Lord,
    To seek only for Thee.
    Make me to understand Thy ways,
    Obey Thee willingly.

3.    Sanctify my soul, I pray,
    Affections and desires;
    Help me to choose
        what Thou hast planned,
    And to that end aspire.

4.    Sanctify my being, Lord,
    To serve Thee faithfully,
    Giving each member
        to be made
    Available to Thee.

5.    Make me a holy vessel, Lord,
    Just set apart for Thee.
    Lord, purify my every thought,
    Each word and every deed.

6.    A vision of Thy holiness,
    Lord, give that I might see
    How holy, harmless, undefiled,
    Thy loving bride should be.

7.    Partaking of Thy holiness,
    I look for that blest day
    When Thou wilt come
        to take me as
    Thy spotless bride away.
