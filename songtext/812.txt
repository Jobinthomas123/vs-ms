2.	Take time to be holy;
	The world rushes on.
	Spend much time in secret
	With Jesus alone;
	By looking to Jesus,
	Like Him thou shalt be.

	His likeness shall see.

	Let Him be thy Guide,
	And run not before Him
	Whatever betide.
	In joy or in sorrow
	Still follow thy Lord,
	And looking to Jesus,
	Still trust in His Word.

4.	Take time to be holy;
	Be calm in thy soul—
	Each tho’t and each motive
	Beneath His control.
	Thus led by His Spirit
	To fountains of love,
	Thou soon shalt be fitted
	For service above.
