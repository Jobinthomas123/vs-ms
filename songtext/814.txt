1.    Laying up my treasures
                    A       B  E
    In my home above,
                                  C#m
    Trusting, fully trusting
                  F#m           B   — B7
    In the Savior’s love,
        E
    Doing what I can
                                   E/G#   A
    For heaven’s Holy Dove,
     E                    C#m
    I’m getting ready
               F#m    B        E
        to leave this world.

Chorus:
    E
    I’m getting ready
            A         B         E
    To leave this world.
                           C#m
    I’m getting ready
                    F#m           B — B7
    For the gates of pearl.
        E
    Keeping my garments white,
    C#m
    Watching both day and night,
    E                      C#m
    I’m getting ready
           F#m    B        E
    To leave this world!

2.    Trusting in the riches
    Of His saving grace,
    In each earthly trial
    I His love can trace;
    Sure that up in heaven
    I shall find a place,
    I’m getting ready
        to leave this world.

3.    To prepare a mansion
    Jesus said “I’ll go,
    If it were not true
    I would have told you so”.
    Well, just a little while
    To linger here below;
    I’m getting ready
        to leave this world.
