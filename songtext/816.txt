1.    He giveth more grace
                          Am                         Dm7
    When the burdens grow greater;
             G                           G7
    He sendeth more strength
                          F  G   G/B   C      — G
    When the labors increase.
           C              C7
    To added affliction,
            F                    Dm7
    He addeth His mercy;
              C                  Am
    To multiplied trials,
               Dm  C/G     G         C
    His mul—ti—plied peace.

Chorus:
              G                   G/B
    His love has no limit,
               C                       C/E
    His grace has no measure,
              F                          Dm
    His power has no boundary
             C                    G   — G7
        known unto men;
           C                   C/E
    For out of His infinite
        F                  Dm
        riches in Jesus,
            C                    Am
    He giveth, and giveth,
                 Dm  C/G G   C
        and gi—veth again!

2.    When we have exhausted
    Our store of endurance,
    When our strength has failed
    Ere the day is half done,
    When we reach the end of our
    Hoarded resources,
    Our Father’s full giving
    Is only begun.
