Chorus:
	                   E                        B/D#
	What is man that You are
		                C#m
		mindful of him,
	                   A          E/G#
	And the son of man,
		                   B4              — B
		that You visit him?
	                                       E
	Why should You crown him with
		 B/D#           C#m
		glory and honor?
	                          A                            E
	Though he’s only made of dust,
	                    F#m                             B4
	You’ve planned for him in love—
	     B                 E
	What great love!

	           E                                  C#m
1.	He brought me from an awful pit,
	         A                        B
	Out of the miry clay;
	          E
	My feet He placed on
		   C#m
		Christ the Rock,
	      F#m                     B
	Forever here to stay.
	       A
	A new song fills my
		   B                B/D#
		heart and soul;
	           E                         C#m
	To worship Him is now my goal,
	          F#m      F#7/A#  B   —B7/D#
	And that is why I say …

2.	Behold, what kind of love is this
	The Father’s given me,
	That I’d be called a son of God—
	The world cannot believe.
	When He appears, I’ll be like Him,
	Then I’ll behold Him as He is;
	His glorious face I’ll see!

3.	My body, soul and spirit now
	Belong to Christ alone.
	He’s sealed me by His Spirit;
		for Redemption’s day I groan.
	I’ll live for Him both
		day and night;
	I’ll serve Him now with
		all my might,
	And own Him as my own.

4.	Jesus has gone to build a place
	Especially for me,
	And when it’s done,
		He’ll take me home—
	The bride of my great King!
	Enthroned with Him
		in purest light,
	In holy garments clean and white,
	A conqu’ror I will be!

5.	I see the Lamb on Zion’s mount
	Now calling unto me;
	I hear Him say,
		“Take up your cross
	And follow faithfully.
	Come leave your all;
		count not the cost.
	Lay down your life to win the lost,
	And reign eternally.”
