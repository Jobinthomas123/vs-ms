Chorus:
	    G                                D
	Closer to You, O God—
	                      D4          Em
	Grant my heart’s desire:
	  B7          Em         B7 – Am7     Em
	Perfect peace, sustaining grace,
	   C              D      D4      Em
	Burning with holy fire.

	       C                       D
1.	When storms of life
		                       Em
		around me rage,
	  C                         B7                     Em
	Fierce battles threaten to engage,
	               B7
	When faith is weak
		        Am7
		and vision dim,
	           C
	Then I must cling
		             D4             D      -D/F#
		more close to Him.

2.	When questions cloud
		the path I tread,
	Doubts would sway me
		from the goal ahead,
	When choices seem
		so hard to make,
	My Lord will show
		the way to take.

3.	When hope gives way
		and fears abound,
	Barriers come in gaining
		higher ground,
	When losses hide
		the vict’ries won,
	I’ll lift my eyes unto the Son.
