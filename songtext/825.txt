2.	‘Tis mystery all—
		Th’ Immortal dies.
	Who can explore
		His strange design?

	Let angel minds
		inquire no more.

	That Thou, my God,
		shouldst die for me?

3.	He left His Father’s
		throne above—
	So free, so infinite His grace—
	Emptied Himself
		of all but love,
	And bled for Adam’s
		helpless race.
	‘Tis mercy all, immense and free;
	For, O my God, it found out me!
	Amazing love! How can it be
	That Thou, my God,
		shouldst die for me?

4.	Long my imprisoned spirit lay
	Fast bound in sin
		and nature’s night.
	Thine eye diffused
		a quickening ray;
	I woke, the dungeon
		flamed with light.
	My chains fell off;
		my heart was free.
	I rose, went forth,
		and followed Thee.
	Amazing love! How can it be
	That Thou, my God,
		shouldst die for me?

5.	No condemnation now I dread;
	Jesus, and all in Him is mine!
	Alive in Him, my living Head,
	And clothed in righteouness divine,
	Bold I approach the  eternal throne,
	And claim the crown,
		through Christ my own.
	Amazing love! How can it be
	That Thou, my God,
		shouldst die for me?
