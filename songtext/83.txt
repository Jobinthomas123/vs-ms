    E                            E7     A
    One thing have I desired
                      E
        of the Lord,
                    C#m        F#m-B7
    That will I seek after;
              E               E7                 A
    That I may dwell in the house
                      E
        of the Lord
                     B                   E-E7
    All the days of my life;


                  A
    To behold the beauty
                      Eâ€”C#m
        of the Lord,
                 F#m         B7          A  -  E
    And to inquire in His temple. x2
