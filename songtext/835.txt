1.	Jesus is coming soon—
	           B             B7/D#               E
	Our hope throughout the ages.
	                       E7            A       F#m
	Now He is drawing ever near;
	              B            B7/D#       E
	We’ll rise up soon to meet Him.

Chorus:
	A              B      E                   C#m
	For we have one hope, one faith,
	            A              F#m           B
	One God and Father of all
	                 A          B   G#m7           C#m
	Who’ll gather us unto His throne.
	        A                     B
	No more good-byes;
	             G#m7     C#m
	We’re going home.
	                        F#m        B   B7/D# E
	How we’re longing for that day!

2.	He that shall come will come;
	No longer will He tarry.
	Let us look up,
		redemption’s nigh;
	We’ll don our glorious body!

3.	The family of God is great;
	His Spirit and blood unite us,
	The bond of perfectness—
		His love,
	Is flowing freely through us.

4.	When He has built up Zion,
	The Lord shall come in glory;
	Then we shall see Him as He is—
	Perfected in His image.
