2.Like a great and mighty warrior
He has risen as from slumber,
Smiting all our enemies,
Driving them away.
To devour like a lion,
So our God will fight for Zion;
He’ll defend Jerusalem,
Roaring on His prey.

3.Through great tests and ev’ry trial,
We have learned
to lean upon Him.
Coming from the wilderness,
He’s become our strength.
Very present help in trouble,
Fortress we can run and hide in—
Who could ever touch us there?
Shelter from the storm.

4.Soon He will return to take us,
No more enemies to taunt us;
We’ll abide forever there,
Resting in His arms.
When He comes in all His glory,
Then He’ll gather us before Him;
And we’ll serve Him
all our days—
Maranatha! Come!
