2.	My soul shouts glory
		to the Son of God;
	Not a cloud nor a care I see.
	My hope is clinging
		with a perfect trust
	To the cross He has borne for me.

3.	My soul shouts glory
		to the Son of God;
	In His secret place I dwell.
	His constant presence
		overshades me there,
	And my joy there is none can tell.

4.	My soul shouts glory
		to the Son of God,
	And I know it will not be long
	Till oâ€™er the river
		where the saints have gone,
	I shall join their eternal song.
