                    E                                  E7
    Reach out and touch the Lord
               A                 E
        as He passes by;
                                                      C#m
    You’ll find He’s not too busy
              F#m                           B
        to hear your heart’s cry.
                 E                             E7
    He’s passing by this moment--
                   A                       E
        your needs to supply.
                   E                                   C#m
    Reach out and touch the Lord
            F#m  B       E
        as He goes by.
