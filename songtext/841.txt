              E                               A     B   E
1.    The power that fell at Pentecost
                A                         E
    When in the upper room.
        B
    Upon the watching,
            E
        waiting ones
               F#                           B
    The Holy Ghost had come—
            E             A       E
    Remaineth evermore the same,
                              C#m
    Unchanging still,
           F#m       B     E
        O praise His name.

Chorus:

    The pow’r, the pow’r,
                  A                     E
        the Pentecostal pow’r,
          B                         B7
    Is just the same today,
              E
        is just the same today.
                                     E7
    The pow’r, the pow’r,
                  A                    E
        the Pentecostal pow’r,
        E/B          A/B         E
    Is just the same today.

2.    “Ye shall have power,”
        said Jesus, “when
    The Holy Ghost is come.”
    Your loosened tongues
        shall speak His praise;
    Your lips no more be dumb.
    The timid, shrinking ones be brave
    To reach a hand the lost to save.

3.    The wav’ring shall
        steadfast become;
    The weak in faith be strong,
    With holy boldness going forth,
    Denouncing sin and wrong,
    With burning zeal
        each heart aflame,
    A whole salvation  to proclaim

4.    Breathe on us now the Holy Ghost,
    The young and old inspire;
    Let each receive his Pentecost—
    Set hearts and tongues afire!
    Thou wonderful
        transforming Power,
    Come now in this accepted hour.
