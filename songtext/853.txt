C
    They hated him;

    They tore his coat
              F               G          C
        and threw him into a pit.

    They sold him for a sum of money
               F                                         C
    And lied to their dad about it.
                                       Em
    But when these brothers
                    Am
        came to Joseph—
                   E                                  F
    That heartless, loveless band—
                                 G
    He wept and kissed and
                Em             Am
        and fed them all
                Dm                       G                C
    And gave them the very best land.


    A heart like Joseph
                             Dm - G
        we ask, O Lord,
                                   Dm     G
    That we may serve You
                     C          G
        with one accord,
                                        C
    That Your great love

    Might spread across the world
              C7                 F
    And to our enemies—
                               G            Em  -   Am
    A love that will not waver
               Dm     G   C
    And will not cease,
            F                 G            Em  -  Am
    A love that will not waver
               Dm    G    C
    And will not cease.
