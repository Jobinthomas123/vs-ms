Chorus:
	D                      G
	Willing to share,
                 A                 D
	 I’m willing to bear
	            G               D         E7            A
	The cross that Jesus bore for me;
	   D                    G
	Bearing the pain,
		         A                         Bm
		the reproach and shame,
	        G            A           D
	He died to set me free.

	    G                       A
1.	Teach me the way,
		        F#m               Bm
		the way of the cross,
	         Em                A         D     D7
	To understand all it means:
	        G                A
	To die to myself
		           F#               Bm
		that Jesus may live,
	            E               E/G#                A   A7
	His fragrance revealed in me.

2.	I must not shun
		the way of the cross,
	The cross that He bore for me.
	What things that were dear,
		I’ll lay them aside
	And follow Him joyfully.

3.	Teach me to stay,
		to stay at the cross;
	Abiding brings heav’nly rest,
	For only a life
		surrendered to Him
	The heav’nly Father will bless.

4.	Give me a heart
		to love that dear cross—
	Jesus bore all for me.
	With all of my heart,
		embracing His will,
	I’ll serve Him eternally.
