    A                   E              D
1.    When the poor and needy
                    A
        seek water
               D        E                  A
    Then I the Lord will hear them;
                      D -Bm                         E
    I’ll open rivers, refreshing rivers
                D                 E – E7       A
    To revive each thirsting soul.

Chorus:
                                    A
    We need Your power,
                         D
        mighty power
           A                               E7
    Descend on us, we pray.
                           A
    Fill every vessel
                                  D
        with living water;
              E           E7          A
    Satisfy our need today.

2.    It’s the promise of the Father:
    You shall receive great power;
    Trust in His Word now
        and come believing
    For the Holy Ghost and fire.

3.    We are changed
from glory to glory
    Transformed by the anointing;
    The Lord is giving
        to all who seek Him
    Overcoming grace today.
