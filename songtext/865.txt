       A       D                            E
1.    Lord, let Your light shine
                          A
        through me,
               D
    That others may see
              E                      A
    Not my life but Thine:
                  D
    Your nature divine
         E                     A
        lived out in me.

Chorus:
                         A                 D           A
    Let Your power prevail in me;
                    D                     E
    In my weakness reveal
                         A
        Your strength.
          D                  E
    As I learn to die,
                                    C#m     F#m
        Your name is lifted high
                D              E      A
    And You are glorified.

2.    Lord, let Your pow’r flow
        through me—
    Your Spirit consume
    All darkness in me,
    Imparting Your grace and victory.

3.    Lord, establish Your throne in me.
    Come reign in my life;
    Transformed I will be.
    Your face soon I’ll see eternally.
