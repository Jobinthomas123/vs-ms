       E   B
    He touched me,
                      E
    Oh, He touched me.
              A             E
    And oh, the joy that floods
                B
        my soul!
      E                    A
    Something happened
                  E           A
        and now I know,
             E
    He touched me
                   B                  E
        and made me whole.
