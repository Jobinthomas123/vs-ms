1.    Have fear and doubt
                        D                     G
        come against your mind?
                          C
    Has your faith been
          D           G     -G7
        sorely tried?
      C                      A7/C#
    Lift up your eyes;
                    G                       E7
        here cometh your help!
              Am                 C            D      G
    It is Jesus—for you He has died!

Chorus:
      G
    Rise and be healed
                      G7            C
        in the name of Jesus;
                         D                       G
    Let faith arise in your soul!

    Rise and be healed
                       G7           C      -A7
        in the name of Jesus;
                      G
    He will cleanse
                   D        D7       G
        and make you whole!

2.    If by faith
        you reach out to Him,
    He will meet your ev’ry need.
    He will respond
        to the cry of your heart;
    He will touch you and set you free.
