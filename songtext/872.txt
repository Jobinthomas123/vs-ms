My Comforter, my All in All—

Here in the love of Christ I stand.

2.In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love
and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones
He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied,
For every sin on Him was laid.
Here in the death of Christ I live.

3.There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world
by darkness slain.
Then bursting forth
in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His, and He is mine,
Bought with the precious
blood of Christ.

4.No guilt in life, no fear in death—
This is the power of Christ in me.
From life’s first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my desti—ny.
No power of hell,
no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand.
Till He returns or calls me home;
Here in the power of Christ
I’ll stand!
