1.Trusting in the Lord,
	              G                 C
	I will never be ashamed;
	                 F                           C
	As I’m leaning on His arms,
	           Dm                    G
	How could I ever fall?
	             E4
	For I know that His Word—
	                 E
	Every promise
		                         Am - G/B- C
		He gave to me—
	             F                 C/E
	Is as sure, even more,
	                    Dm      G4 - G
	Than the air I breathe.

Chorus:
	               C                  G
	I will trust, ever trust.
	                Am
	Holding to the One
	              F                          G4 - G
	Who holds me, I will trust.
	                     Dm
	When the way
		                                  C/E
		grows dark and stormy,
	                   F
	Should I doubt
		                             C/E
		His goodness toward me,
	               Dm                          G
	For I know my God is for me:
		             F  -  C
		I will trust.

2.	Listening for His voice,
	I can hear my Savior say,
	“It’s by faith and not by sight
	I call you now to walk.”
	And I know that this path
	He has chosen just for me
	Leads me home where He is
	For eternity.
