               G                           G7
1.	I’ve cast my heavy burdens
	                        C                               G
		down on Canaan’s happy shore;

	I’m living where the
		   Em                      Am7-D
		healing waters flow.
	          G                          G7
	I’ll wander in the wilderness
		        C                               G
		of doubt and sin no more;

	I’m living where the
		  Am7          D         G
		healing waters flow.

Chorus:
	  G                           G7
	Living on the shore,
	         C                           G
	I’m living on the shore;

	I’m living where the
		   Em                       Am7-D7
		healing waters flow.
	  G                           G7
	Living on the shore,
	         C                           G
	I’m living on the shore;

	I’m living where the
		   Am7        D           G
		healing waters flow.

2.	With Israel’s trusting children
	I’m rejoicing on my way;
	I’m living where the
		healing waters flow.
	The cloudy-fiery pillar is my
		guiding light today;
	I’m living where the
		healing waters flow.

3.	My hung’ring soul is satisfied with
		manna from above;
	I’m living where the
		healing waters flow.
	No more I thirst, the Rock I’ve
		found,that Fount of endless love;
	I’m living where the
		healing waters flow.

4.	I’m singing “Hallelujah,”
		safely anchored in my soul;
	I’m living where the
		healing waters flow.
	I’m resting on His promises;
	The blood has made me whole.
 	I’m living where the
		healing waters flow.
