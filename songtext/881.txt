 EA/F#
1.There’s a call comes ringing
 E/G# C#m7
o’er the restless wave,
 F#m-B7   E
“Send the light! Send the light!”
  EA/F#
There are souls to rescue,
  E/G#C#m7
There are souls to save:
   F#m-B7 E
Send the light! Send the light!

Chorus:
E
Send the light—
 C#m7
The blessed gospel light;
  F#m7-B E
Let it shine from shore to shore!

Send the light!
 C#m7
And let its radiant beams
F#m7-B E
Light the world forevermore.

2.We have heard the Macedonian
call today,
“Send the light! Send the light!”
And a golden offering
at the cross we lay:
Send the light! Send the light!

3.Let us pray that grace
may everywhere abound.
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christ-like spirit
everywhere be found:
Send the light! Send the light!

4.Let us not grow weary
in the work of love.
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels
for a crown above.
Send the light! Send the light!
