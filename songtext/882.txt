	It’s all about You,   Jesus;
	                              Bm-G
	And all this is for You,
	                     D                               A
	For Your glory and Your fame.
	                               Bm-G
	It’s not about me,
	              D
	As if You should do things
		   G
		my way—
	Bm                          A
	You alone are God,
		                   G                              D
		and I surrender to Your ways.
