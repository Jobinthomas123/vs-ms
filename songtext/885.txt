    E                          Bsus
1.    Light of the world,
                               F#m
    You stepped down into darkness,
    E                      Bsus                  A
    Opened my eyes, let me see
    E                         Bsus
    Beauty that made
                   F#m
        this heart adore you—
    E                  Bsus                       A
    Hope of a life spent with You

Chorus:
                                   E
    Here I am to worship,
                                 B
    Here I am to bow down,
                                C#m
    Here I am to say that
                         E      A
        You’re my God.
                                           E
    You’re altogether lovely,
                               B
    Altogether worthy,
                               C#m                  A
    Altogether wonderful to me.

2.    King of all days,
    Oh so highly exalted,
    Glorious in heaven above.
    Humbly You came
        to the earth You created
    All for love’s sake became poor.

Bridge:
                        Bsus      E
    And, I’ll never know
                    A
        how much it cost
           Bsus       E       A
    To see my sin upon that cross.
