1.    Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
     E                  A         F#m    E  B     E
    Pilgrim through this barren land.
       A     E                                     B
    I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
      E                 A                E       B      E
    Hold me with Thy pow’rful hand.

    Bread of Heaven,
      E            F#m                        E     B
    Feed me till I want no more.
     E              A            E    B7   E
    Feed me till I want no more.

2.    Open now the crystal fountain,
    Whence the healing stream
doth flow;
    Let the fire and cloudy pillar
    Lead me all my journey through.
    Strong Deliv’rer, strong Deliv’rer,
    Be Thou still my Strength
and Shield.
    Be Thou still my Strength
and Shield.

3.    When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside;
    Bear me through
the swelling current—
    Land me safe on Canaan’s side.
    Songs of praises, songs of praises,
    I will ever give to Thee;
    I will ever give to Thee.

4.    Musing on my habitation,
    Musing on my heav’nly home,
    Fills my soul with holy longings:
    Come, my Jesus, quickly come.
    Vanity is all I see;
    Lord, I long to be with Thee!
    Lord, I long to be with Thee!
