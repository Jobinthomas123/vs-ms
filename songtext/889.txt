   D               A/D
1.	Jesus Christ,
		     G/D                         D
		I think upon Your sacrifice;
     G                         D/F#
	You became nothing,
          G                         Asus -A
		poured out to death.
        D       A/D               G/D
	Many times I’ve wondered
                          D
		at Your gift of life,
              G                      Asus  A          D
	And I’m in that place once again;
     G                      Asus   A       D
	I’m in that place once again.

Chorus:
     D/F#                   G                         D/F#
	Once again I look upon the cross,
		                          A
		where You died;
              D/F#                              G
	I’m humbled by Your mercy,
                           Bm          Asus A
		and I’m broken inside.
     Bm7                    G
	Once again I thank You;
     D/F#                    A                     G     D
	Once again I pour out my life.

2.	Now You are
		exalted to the highest place,
	King of the heavens,
		where one day I’ll bow.
	But for now I marvel
		at this saving grace,
	And I’m full of praise once again;
	I’m full of praise once again.

Bridge:
       G                                   Asus-A
	Thank You for the cross.
       D/F#                             G
	Thank You for the cross.
      Asus                                 A
	Thank You for the cross,
		            D
	  my Friend.
