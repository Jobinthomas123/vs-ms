         D                        Dsus
    Nothing in this world
                         D          Dsus
        can satisfy me.
      D         A/C# G/B               D/A      C    A7
    Jesus, You alone can fill me up.
     D                                Dsus
    I could gain the world
                             D                Dsus
        and all its treasures,
            D                  A/C#
    But all those things
                      G/B    D/A    C      A7
        would never be enough.

                           D
    It is Your love,
                           Em
    It is Your goodness,
               D/F#  G
    It is Your kindness
                       D/F#
    And compassion
                G            D   G -A
    That fill me up inside.
                          D
    It is Your grace,
                                Em
    Your tender mercies,
              D/F#   G                            A7
    It is Your presence in my life
                           D
        that satisfies.
