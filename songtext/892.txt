Chorus:
                        G
    In Your power,

    I will run and not be weary.
                                              C -D7
    I will walk and not faint;

    I’ll wait on You.
                                   G
    Lord, in Your power,
                                                Am7
    I will run and not be weary.
                                              C -D7
    I will walk and not faint;

    I’ll trust in You.

      C                            D
1. You help me mount up
                   C               G
        with eagle’s wings,
               C                            D
    And You strengthen me
                    B7             Em
        as I wait patiently.
                C                D
    New hope I receive,
                            Bm            Em
        as Your Word I believe.
                 C                   G
    This race I’ve begun,
                     Am7                   D  -D7
        to the end help me run.

2. With Your eyes on me,
        You light my way.
    With my hand in Yours,
        I know my step is sure.
    If my way’s unclear,
        still Your presence is near;
    And You’ll help me stay
        to the end in Your way.

3.    In the high places
        You help me ride;
    I’m lifted above
        by Your powerful love.
    Yes, I’ll soar beyond
        every fear and all wrong,
    And then on that day,
        You will catch me away.
