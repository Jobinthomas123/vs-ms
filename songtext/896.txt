1.    Wonderful, merciful Savior,
      C                     F                       G
    Precious Redeemer and Friend,
      Am                               Am/G
    Who would have thought
                       F
        that a Lamb could
        C/G               G              Am
    Rescue the souls of men?
      F                 C/G              G              C
    Oh, You rescue the souls of men.

Chorus:
      Am                   Am/G                F    G
    You are the One that we praise;
      Am                  Am/G        F  G
    You are the One we adore.
    Am                      Am/G                 F
    You give the healing and grace our
      C/G                       G            Am
    Hearts always hunger for.
      F            C/G                       G            C
    Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

2.    Counselor, Comforter, Keeper,
    Spirit we long to embrace,
    You offer hope
        when our hearts have
    Hopelessly lost the way,
    Oh, we hopelessly lost the way.

3.    Almighty, infinite Father,
    Faithfully loving Your own,
    Here in our weakness
        You find us
    Falling before Your  throne.
    Oh, weâ€™re falling
        before Your throne.
