  A   ED
1.Over all the earth,
  E  A
You reign on high,
   E D
Every mountain stream,
EF#m
every sunset sky.
   E D
But my one request,
  EBm
Lord, my only aim
  D E  A
Is that You’d reign in me again.

Chorus:
ED
Lord, reign in me;
   E   A
Reign in Your power
E   D
Over all my dreams,
   E   F#m
in my darkest hour.
E  D   E  Bm
You are the Lord of all I am,
 DEA
So won’t You reign in me again?

2.Over every thought,
Over every word,
May my life reflect
  the beauty of my Lord,
Cause You mean more to me
  than any earthly thing.
So won’t You reign in me again?
