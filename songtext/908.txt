Chorus:
	               G
	Here I am,
		                                     Am7
		with outstretched arms—
    G/B                                  C
	Open and ready to hear
		              D
		Your voice.
	                    G                          Am7
	Speak to me, speak clearly;
	          G/B
	It’s Your sweet voice
		          C                     D
		I’m longing to hear.
	         Em                                 A7
	I’m patiently waiting, Lord;
	                    Am7             D               G
	Take my hand and lead the way.

	             C                            D
1.	When I feel like this road
		                  G                 -Em
		is going nowhere;
	     C
	Trouble surrounds me
		 D                          G    -D/F#
		like a roaring sea,
	                       Em
	When my head hangs low
		              C
		with shame,
	                   Em                                C–G/B
	And my heart is filled with pain,
	      Am              G/B           C
	I need You, Lord, to answer
		A/C#       D4   -D
		when I call.

2.	I’m trusting in the plan
		You have for me;
	I know that I can’t
		make it on my own.
	Lord, I’m giving You control;
	I’ll hold on and won’t let go.
	Now I’ll follow in the way
		that You have shown.
