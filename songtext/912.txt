       Dm                            A
1. Soon the Lord of glory
                    A7                               Dm
        will come—what blest morning!
                                           A
    We do watch and pray,
                        A/C#        Dm
        waiting for that day
                            C    Bb
    When we will rise
                 A                             Dm
        to meet Him in the skies.

Chorus:
    D7/F#     Gm        C
    We’ll bow before Him,
                                F            Dm
        and we’ll worship Him,
           Gm           A
    Rejoice and evermore
                Dm    -D/F#
        proclaim
              Gm           C
    The work of glory
                             F                Dm
        and His wondrous grace
                     Gm        A             Dm
    Shown forth in us that day.

2.    Holy is Mount Zion,
        the Lord’s habitation;
    New Jerusalem,
        where God dwells with men—
    And in that place
        one day with Him we’ll reign.
