	  (E)              F#m7
1.	Lord, You came to earth
		                                               B
		and gave Your all for me;
	                        F#m7
	You poured out Your life
		                                    B
		and died on Calvary.
	                   G#m                                A
	You bore my reproach and shame;
		                     G#m                             C#7
		You have washed my every stain.
	                      F#m7
	Lord, from sin You’ve
		                 E/G#
		rescued me;
		                      A                          B
		by Your blood I am set free.

Chorus:
	                   E – B/D#
	You are faithful;
	            C#m                   Bm   –E7
	Your promises are true.
	                 A                         E/G#
	Your Word will never fail me;
	  F#m                           B
	I put my trust in You
	                                   E - B/D#
	Because You’re faithful,
	C#m                                Bm    -E7
	By Your grace I’ll stand.
	        A                               E/G#
	I know You will preserve me
	F#m7                  B
	‘Til the very end—
	                     A    -E
	You are faithful.

2.	You have promised
		by Your stripes alone I’m healed;
	You have sent Your Word,
		to me Your truth revealed.
	You have carried all my pain;
		in me glorify Your name.
	Lord, I lift my eyes to You, for I
		know You’ll see me through.

3.	You have promised
		to complete Your work in me,
	And one day Your glorious face
		I know I’ll see.
	You have called me by Your grace;
		Lord, please help me run this race.
	In Your presence I will be,
		now and through eternity.
