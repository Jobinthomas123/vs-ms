Chorus:
	                E4                                   E
	Lo, on Zion’s mount You stand,
	                 G#m7                           C#m
	Rod of strength is in Your hand
	                    A                                 E/G#
	As Your loving voice commands,
		    F#m7                            B
		“Come and follow Me!”
	                   E4                             E
	I will forsake my all and cling
	                             G#7                        C#m
	To You, Who gave me everything;
	                           A
	You are my Life, my Love,
		           E
		my King—
		                   A            B                 E
		to You alone I pledge my life.

	               E/G#                    A
1.	There’s no place on earth
		                     B                     E
		like the house of the Lord,
	              C#m7             F#7
	Where Your holy beauty
		     F#m7                     B
		is praised and adored.
	        E/G#                           A
	To dwell with Your saints
		      G#7                   C#m7
		is such sweet reward—
	           F#m7                                   B4    -B
	Then what will it be over there?

2.	This glorious hope
		will brighten the way,
	Giving songs in the night
		and strength for each day;
	And after it all, I’ll hear You say,
	“My precious servant, well done!”

3.	My heart could know
		no greater love
	Than that which was poured
		from Your heart above.
	This calling is more
		than all I’d dreamed of—
	I fall at Your feet, and I cry.
