                          G/C         C
1.    By Your mercies, Lord,
    Dm                    F/G          C
    You’ve kept me till now;
                    Dm                            G
    And I'll never know just how
    F                       G                  C
    You came and chose me
             Dm                            G
    As a vessel of Your mercy.
            Bb                       F
    It’s so hard to believe,
                  G                     (F/A) (G/B)
    But I thank You.

Chorus:
                       C
    All I can do
        Am                           Dm
    Is lift my hands to You
         G              E/G#    Am
    In grateful adoration.
                        G
    I’m overwhelmed
                          F       G               C
    By Your marvelous salvation.
    Am   Bb                   F            G     C
    Oh, Lord, Your mercy endures.

2.    By Your mercies, Lord,
    We are not consumed.
    Every morning You have proved
    That all else may change,
    Yet Your mercy e’er remains;
    And You are still the same,
    So I thank You.
