	C                            Dm                     G
1.	I was made to worship You
	                                C       Am
	In spirit and in truth.
				        Dm	          G
	May my praise be pure and true,
	                                    C
	As incense just for You.

Chorus
	                     Am           F
	My heart cries out,
	   G                            C              Am
	“Holy are You, Lord.”
	             F                  Dm
	Only pure praise
		                           G
	Is what You deserve.
		          Am              Dm           G
	In the beauty of holiness
	                             Am    D
	I will worship You;
	             C/E                F           G
	In the beauty of holiness
	                             C
	I will worship You.

2.	More than just the songs I sing,
	My life’s the praise I’ll bring.
	I give to You my everything;
	Please take my offering.

3.	Teach me how to worship You
	In spirit and in truth,
	So that the praise I give to You
	Ascends as sweet perfume.
