Chorus:
    Em
    For the mighty Lord of hosts
            Am
    Has won the victory,
     D
    Shouts of joy resounding
                            Em
        from the Lord’s army.
               Am
    He’s lifted up the standard,
               Em
        destroyed the enemy;
    D                                 B7-
    For Jehovah Nissi
                                           Em
        has won the victory.

    Am
1.    Who has defied
                Em
        the army of the Lord?
    D                            B7
    Say unto the Philistine,
                        Em         E/G#
        “You’ll be no more.”
    Am
    For our God has gone
        Em
        as a man of war;
    D                                                 B7
    Sing and shout the victory
                                      Em
        to the Lord of lords.

2.    Be strong in God
        and in His mighty power.
    Do not fear the enemy;
        the battle’s won.
    Girding up yourselves
        with the strength of God,
    Stand and see deliverance
        come this very hour.

3.    Trusting in Him,
        we’ll never be ashamed;
    We shall rise up on the wings
        of prayer and praise.
    For we know that hell
        surely won’t prevail—
    Everlasting Word of God
        never, ever fails.
