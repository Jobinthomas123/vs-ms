               Dmaj7  A/C#
	I never knew every time
	  G                 A              Bm
	I heard the thunder roar,
	              G
	Your voice was there
		    Em
		reminding me,
	           A
	You love me;
	                         Dmaj7
	And I never knew that when
		            G
		the lightning flashed,
	       Bm                                D/A
	The promise of Your presence
	            G
	Was telling me,
 	    Em                               A
		“I will always be with you.”

	           G                      A
	I can feel it in the rain;
	           F#m                    Bm
	I can hear it in the wind.
	          G                                  A
	I can see that it’s Your hand
	                               G                       A
	That guides me to the other side.
	                 G                                       A
	Lord, I know You’re always there,
	            F#m                            Bm
	And I feel Your endless love
	         G
	Surrounding me
	       A               A7         D
	As I reach out to You.
