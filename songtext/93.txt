	Fill my cup, Lord;
	                        D
	I lift it up, Lord.
	                       Am                   D7
	Come and quench this thirsting
		              G

	                     G              G7
	Bread of heaven, feed me
	               C              Am
		till I want no more.
	                 D                 D7
	Fill my cup; fill it up
		                                 G
		and make me whole.
