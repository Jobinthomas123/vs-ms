		oh Lord, I pray;
	May Your kingdom reign
		within my heart today.
	Filled with joy and peace,
	Fear and doubt must flee;
	In Your presence
		I will live eternally.

3.	Holding to Your Word of promise,
		I believe;
	Trusting only in Your grace,
		Lord, I receive.
	Glorious truth revealed,
	Sin and sickness healed,
	One by one till every Word
		has been fulfilled.
