Chorus:
                            Dm
    There is a Rock that is

        higher than I—
                        Gm                           A4  A7
    A mighty Rock that I can run to.
               Gm
    If I abide there,
                     Dm
        I will never be moved;
                              A7
    His name is Jesus,
                                     Dm
        my firm Foundation.

                          Gm
1.    When the children of Israel
           Dm
        wandered
                  A                       Dm
    In a desert land so dry,
                Gm
    The Smitten Rock
            Dm
    He gave them to drink—
                        A
    Jehovah Cela—
                                    Gm
    That Rock was Christ.

2. When the ground all around me
        is shaking,
    And I fear my feet may fall,
    I’ll cling to Him Who’s
        steadfast and true.
    The Rock of Ages,
        my Strength, my All.

3.    When the enemy rages against me
    With his lies and evil plans,
    I listen to the voice of my Lord;
    He keeps me safely
        within His hands.

4.    Oh, the Lord is
        my Strong Habitation.
    He’s the Shelter from the storm;
    My great High Tower,
        in Him I’ll abide,
    The One Who hides me,
        safe and secure.

5. In the arms of the One Who
        does hold me,
    Wondrous peace and joy is mine.
    Until He comes,
        I’m kept in His love;
    I’ll go with Him,
        oh, rapture divine!
