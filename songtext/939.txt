Chorus:
                      D
    When my heart is
        A/C#    Bm       Am7 -D7
        overwhelmed,
     G                             D/F#
    Lead me to the Rock
                     Em                 A
        that is higher than I;
                          D
    When my heart is
        F#        G           D/F#
        overwhelmed,
     Em                              A                D
    Lead me to Your presence, Lord.

                            G        A           F#m    Bm
1.    There's no other place I know
                 Em       A             Am7   D7
    Where I can run and hide;
                       G            A/C#         A/F#    Bm
    He's my Shelter from the storm—
            Em        A       D
    It's there I will abide.

2.    Every burden and each care
    I lay down at His feet;
    As I cling to Him in prayer—
    A fellowship so sweet.

3.    As I wait upon my Lord,
    My soul finds perfect rest;
    There I know my prayer is heard,
    And I am truly blest.

4.    In His presence I will dwell
    Throughout eternity;
    In that glory none can tell,
    Where all is joy and peace.
