    A                                        D2/A
1.	You are not a god created
                           A
	By human hands;
    A                                        D2/A
	You are not a god dependent
                                   A
	On any mortal man.
     A                         A/G#     F#m7
	You are not a god in need of
     D2                              A/C#
	Anything we can give;
    A                E/G#
	By Your plan,
                  C#m7                  D2
	That's just the way it is.

Chorus
                                 A
	You are God alone!
                                          E/G#
	From before time began,
                                           F#m7
	You were on Your throne;
                                    D2
	You were God alone.
                          A
	And right now,
                                                 E/G#
	In the good times and bad,
     C#/F                         F#m7
	You are on Your throne;
                                D2
	You are God alone.

2.	You're the only God Whose power
	None can contend;
	You're the only God
	Whose name and
		praise will never end.
	You're the only God Who's worthy
	Of ev'rything we can give;
	You are God:
	That's just the way it is!

Bridge:
               A
	Unchangeable,
               E/G#
	Unshakable,
              F#m
	Unstoppableâ€”
                                      D2
	That's what You are! x2
