            G/B           C
1.    As morning dawns
                D              G5
        and evening fades,
    G/B       C         D               G5
    You inspire songs of praise
               G/B               C             D
    That rise from earth to touch
                   Em7
        Your heart,
               C       D                     G5
    And glorify Your name.

Chorus:
                Bm7  Em7
    Your name
               G5                                  C2
        is a strong and mighty tower;
                D       Em7
    Your name
               G5                         C2
        is a shelter like no other.
                D       Em7
    Your name,
                     G5                        C2
        let the nations sing it louder,
                   G/B                         C2
    'Cause nothing has the power
              Dsus  D
        to save
                         G/B     C2 D/F#  G
    But Your name.

2.    Jesus, in Your name we pray;
    Come and fill our hearts today.
    Lord, give us strength to live
        for You,
    And glorify Your name.
