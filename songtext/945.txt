	        E                            B/D#
1.	We lift our voices singing,
                A/C#   B/D#     E
		“All glory to the Lamb!”
             B                                     B/D#
	His blood was shed for sinners;
              A/C#    B/D#     E
		He is the great I AM.
             E/G#                     A
	His name is lifted higher
                  B       B/D#   E
		than any other name—
               C#m            A
	The Alpha and Omega,
                  B           B/D#       E
		from age to age the same.

Chorus:
                  B              B/D#
	Jesus Christ is Lord;
                          E                E/G#
		He’s our Righteousness.
              B             B/D#
	The exalted One—
                     A/C#     B/D#  E
		let His name be blessed!
                  B                  B/D#
	Every knee shall bow,
                    E/G#       A
		every tongue confess:
                B                B/D#
	Jesus Christ is Lord—
             E      A  E
		all victorious!

2.	“The Lamb of God is worthy,”
		the holy angels say;
	So let us bow before Him,
		His gentle voice obey.
	This way, it leads to glory,
		far up above the sky.
	Up there the Lamb is reigning
		with all the saints on high.

3.	The Lamb, He stands on Zion,
		but, oh, at what a cost!
	The way was hard and lonely
		that ended on the cross.
	Lift up your eyes and see Him,
		the One we crucified.
	For us His blood is flowing;
		it was for us He died.

4.	From death the Lamb is risen,
		the crown upon His brow.
	His side, yes, it was riven;
		but all is glory now.
	For us He’s interceding,
		our lives to sanctify;
	And when the trump is sounded
		we’ll meet Him in the sky.

5.	He is the Lion of Judah,
		yet gentle as a Lamb;
	Let’s follow in His footsteps
		to that eternal land.
	For us the crown is waiting
		if faithful we shall be;
	All shouting, “Hallelujah”
		beyond the crystal sea!
