                  C                                  F
1.    The storms of life have beat upon
               Dm
        my shores incessantly;
                C                               F
    The dark night of my trials
         Dm                       Gm6/C
        seems to have no end.
                             F
    Yet there's One Who's pleading
       C
        for me
           E4                E           Am
    Before the throne of mercy,
                         F                                C/E
    And my soul He's holding steady
                       F                                      G
    With the hope He's anchored there.

Chorus:
                            G
    Within the veil,
              G/F                             C
    Surrounded by Your glory
                       E4                    E           Am
    And my soul bursts forth in song,
                          F                    G4 - G
    Crying, “Holy, holy, holy”—
                    F                  G          C
    Seeing my sweet Jesus come
                      E4          E                   Am
    Hearing Father say, "Well done",
                          F                       C/E
    Knowing joy has just begun,
                       Dm7                  G
    And my heart is overcome
                              F         C
        within the veil.

2.    And when I think upon the cross,
        pure love nailed to a tree—
    His sufferings at Calvary,
        pain that set me free—
    And the faith that's interceding
    That I should be made holy—
    I will run the race before me
    Knowing it will finish there…

3.    The trumpet sounds,
        the Lord descends,
        with shout of victory
    The Intercessor's prayers
        now come to an end
    The witnesses and angels
    All praise the Lamb Who's worthy
    As His bride arrayed in glory
    With her Bridegroom enters in…
