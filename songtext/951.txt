    Chorus:
    C                          F               G            C
    Speak to my heart, O Lord, I pray;

    Speak to the need
                      Em        F
        of my soul today.
                               C               G/B   Am
    Send Your Word, and I’ll obey;
                           F
    Speak, O Lord,
                  G                   C
        and have Your way.


                                        C
1.    You sent Your Word—
                  G/B                C
        the world was made;
                                  G
    And by Your Word
                                      C
        the heav’ns remain.
                                                   Em      Am
    Now let Your Word create in me
                                         F
    All that You’ve called me,
         G             C
        Lord, to be.

2.    Hearing Your voice,
        the cedar breaks;
    At Your command
        the desert shakes.
    I hear Your Word
        and yield my will,
    And find my thirsting
        soul is filled.

3.    Sower of life,
        come sow Your seed;
    Let it take root deep down in me,
    Forever settled, mixed with faith,
    Bringing forth fruits of truth
        and grace.
