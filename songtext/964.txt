                                A                        D
1.    Though the battle may be raging
                        E                         A
    And the trial seems so long,
                D                          A/C#
    I can lift my eyes to Jesus;
                    Bm                                 E
    He will fill my heart with song.
                          A                     D
    Soon the trials will be over,
                      E                         F#m
    All the battles will be won,
                             D
    There’ll be no more tears
                  A/C#
        nor sorrows
                     B                               E
    In that land beyond the sun.

Chorus:
       A                        D
    Cast all your burden
        E/G#              A
        upon the Lord;
    A/C#              D
    He will sustain you,
        E/G#                  A
        His grace afford.
    A/C#                         D
    When you are weary,
          E                    F#m
        lean on His breast;
      D                            A/C#
    Find peace and comfort,
         E                A
        eternal strength.

2.    Although none may understand you,
    There is One Who understands;
    And in all life’s situations,
    He will hold you in His hands.
    When there’s no one there to help you,
    He’s the One Who never leaves;
    Listen to Him gently speaking,
    All His promises receive.

3.    When it seems all hope is fading,
    And you feel you can’t go on,
    There’s a strength that comes in waiting;
    There the victory is won.
    As we trust alone in Jesus,
    Who can never, ever fail,
    There’s no need to be discouraged;
    In His presence you’ll prevail.

4.    So, be faithful in the battle;
    Soon we’re going to receive
    The reward for all our labors,
    From our suffering, relief.
    The reward—to be with Jesus
    And to look into His face,
    Then we’ll know that all our trials
    Brought us to that glorious place.
