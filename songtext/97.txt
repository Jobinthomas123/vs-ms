            |G|         *—*|G|*7*
He gives strength to me
       |C|         *—*|A|*m*
 as I worship Him,
        |D|*—*|D|*7*
And my heart is filled
       |G|
 with praise.
        |G|
Jesus breaks the bands
       |C|             *—*|A|*m*
 as I raise my hands,
            |D|            |G|
And gives glorious victory.
