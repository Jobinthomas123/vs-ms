	Send the fire today.
	               E
	Look down and see
		            D            A
		this waiting host,
	            E
	And send the promised
		    D           A
		Holy Ghost.
	          F#m                      E       A
	We need another Pentecost;
	  D                E         A
	Send the fire today.

Chorus:

2.	God of Elijah, hear our cry;
	Send the fire.
	And, make us fit to live or die;
	Send the fire today.
	To burn up every trace of sin,
	To bring the light and glory in;
	The revolution now begin—
	Send the fire today.

3.	It's fire we want, for fire we plead;
	Send the fire.
	The fire will meet our every need;
	Send the fire today.
	For strength to always
		do what's right,
	For grace to conquer in the fight,
	For power to walk
		the world in white—
	Send the fire today.

4.	To make our weak hearts
		strong and brave,
	Send the fire.
	To live a dying world to save,
	Send the fire today.
	Oh, see us on Your altar lay;
	We give our lives to You today.
	So, crown the offering
		now we pray;
	Send the fire today.
