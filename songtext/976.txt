        D                         G/D                  D
1.What does the cross really mean―
                             Em      D/F#         G
	How Jesus died to set me free?
                             Bm       D           A
	The cross is only foolishness
                Bm      G                      Bm         G
	Till I truly see how my wickedness
     Em                                  A
	Nailed Him to that tree.
                                     G                   D
	And, there will never be a way
                             F#          Bm
	That I could ever repay
                              G
	All that He did for me
    Em – A  –  D
	On Calvary.

Chorus 1:
                                  A
	That's why I thank Him,
       D – G    D
	Thank Him―
           D/F#                    Em
	For taking all my sin,
                 G                        Em
	And now I live for Him
   D/F#          A                      D
	In gratitude for the cross.

2.	What is the beauty of the cross,
	Where it did seem that all was lost―
	That place of mockery and shame
	Where my Savior died
	Bore for me such pain
	When He took my place?
	It is the love He showed to me
	When my life He did redeem.
	Grateful I’ll ever be
	For Calvary.

Chorus 2:
	That’s why I love Him,
	Love Him―
	Because He first loved me,
	And now I live for Him
	In gratitude for the cross.

3.What does the cross mean for me
	Now that my Lord has set me free?
	The cross is not a place to fear
	Because by His blood
	He has drawn me near,
	And now I can see
	That there can only be one way
	That I could ever repay
	All that He did for me
	On Calvary.

Chorus 3:
	That's why I serve Him,
	Serve Him.
	His servant I will be,
	And I will live for Him
	In gratitude for the cross.
