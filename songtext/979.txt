Chorus:
 BmEm
Let the trumpet sound,
 D
Give the battle cry,
  A
Take up your sword―
   F#
There’s a war in the heavenlies.
 Bm   Em
Jesus, our Captain,
   D
Calls us to our knees.
  F#
In prayer we’ll travail,
 F#7Bm
And o’er the enemy prevail.

  D
1. As watchmen on the walls,
  GD
lift up your eyes;
   A
The devil is deceiving those
Bm
who believe his lies.

Shout what is true;
GD
be clear and loud.
   A
Raise up your voice;
  F#7
the alarm we must sound.

2.The weapons of this war
we need not see;
We’re fighting powers of darkness
and principalities.
Battles are won
when on our knees;
We stand with the Lord
and with Him intercede.

3.O Church of God, arise;
be armed with truth.
It’s time to lift the standard;
the days are very few.
Soldiers of Christ,
we’re on His side;
Our hands are to war
and our fingers to fight.
