1. I know Jesus loves me;
           F                             C
    I know that Jesus cares,

    And way up in His glory
        Dm           G
    I will be there.
           C
    I know Jesus loves me;
           F                G          C
    I know that Jesus cares.

Chorus:
                C
    He's coming back in glory;
                                                   G
    We'll meet Him in the air.
                        C
    What a shout we'll make
              C7
        before Him
      F                     D7
    Going over there―
      G                                                  C
    Oh Hallelu! He’s coming soon.

2.    Do you know Jesus loves you?
    Do you know that Jesus cares?
    And, way up in his glory
    Will you be there?
    Do you know Jesus loves you?
    Do you know that Jesus cares?

3.    I know Jesus lives now;
    He’s risen from the dead.
    I'm holding on to Him,
    My exalted Head.
    I know Jesus lives now;
    He’s risen from the dead.

4. The bride’s getting ready;
    Oh, soon she’ll meet the Lord.
    She is sanctified
    By His living Word.
    The bride’s getting ready;
    Oh, soon she’ll meet the Lord.
