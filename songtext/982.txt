                          E
1. There's a land that is
         A                   E
        fairer than day,
                                                             B
    And by faith we can see it afar;
                      E                     A                 E
    For the Father waits over the way

    To prepare us
                 B                        E
        a dwelling place there.

Chorus:
                      E                     B
    In the sweet by and by
                          B7
    We shall meet on that
                              E
        beautiful shore.
                     E7                    A
    In the sweet by and by
                           E
    We shall meet on that
          B                  E
        beautiful shore.

2.    We shall sing on that
        beautiful shore
    The melodious songs of the blest,
    And our spirits shall
        sorrow no moreâ€•
    Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

3.    To our bountiful Father above,
    We will offer our tribute of praise
    For the glorious gift of His love
    And the blessings that
        hallow our days.
