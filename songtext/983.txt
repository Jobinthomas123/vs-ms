1. You gave up Your throne
             A/C#
		in heaven;
                                         Bm              Em
	You left all Your glory for shame.
               A                    D                A/C#
	You lived out a life of perfection;
                        Bm
	And You ask me
                                        E
		to follow Your way.

Chorus:
                    D
	So I’ll follow You
                                  A/C#
		through the storms;
              D
	I’ll follow You through
                F#m
		the dark nights.
                D
	You followed the path
                 C#               F#m
		that led to the cross.
            Bm              E            G               E
	For me You died, to save my life,
                    D    –  A
	So I’ll follow.

2.	You said to me, “It won’t be easy,
	But in those hard times I’m there.
	You may feel pain and rejection,
	But, this is the path I have
		chosen for you.”

3.	Lord, give me the faith
		to keep pressing;
	Grant me the courage to stand.
	I may not know
		where this road leads,
	But I know Who holds my hand.

Bridge:
                          C#m                     F#m
	I may not know where to turn;
                          C#m                     F#m
	I may not know whom to run to,
                                            Bm
	But You’ve said to Me:
                             A/C#
		“I’ll never fail;
                        D
	I am the One Who has called you
                  E
		My own”.
