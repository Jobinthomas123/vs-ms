                   Bm                  G-A           Bm
    This is Zion, My dwe–lling place,
                         G                 Em-A     Bm
    Ever My rest – I’ve cho–sen it.
                  Bm              Em-Bm
    I will arise – oh, oh, oh
                A       Bm
        – I will arise.
                     Em
    All your enemies
                   A                    D
        I’ll clothe with shame;
                        Em
    You will worship
                   A              Bm
        and exalt My name.

                              Em                           Bm
1. Here I will dwell; here I will rest.
                                 F#
    You are My chosen;
                         Bm
        you are blessed.
     B7          Em                 Bm
    I’ll satisfy abundantly,
                        F#
    For I’ve promised
                                   Bm
        to meet your need.

2. Let my saints shout;
        let them rejoice,
    And all My servants dance for joy.
    I will anoint and separate
    Those whom I’ve chosen
        with Me to reign.

3. For I have sworn and cannot lie―
    All of your children will be mine.
    If they will keep My covenant,
    They will serve Me
        in righteousness.
