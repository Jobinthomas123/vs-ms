1.    There’s a road called

    The holy highway,
                 G                                 D
    That once was a desert land.

    Very soon you’ll hear the sound of
            E7                              A
        a holy, marching band.
               D
    Everlasting joy upon them;
                          G
    There’s a remnant
                             D
    Strong and true.
                                G                          D - Bm
    We bring the song back to Zion;
                                   Em      A7            D
    We bring the praise back to You.

Chorus:
                 D                               G/D
    We exalt You, God Almighty;
                       A/D                      D
    You are worthy to be praised.
                                                 G/D
    Let all nations bow before You—
                  A/D                         D
    Holy Ancient of all days.

2.    There’s a road called
     The holy highway
    Where the people dance and shout,
    Where the enemy is running
    With confusion all about.
    Raise the banner, sing the victory,
    Raise it high—His Word is true.
    We bring the song back to Zion;
    We bring the praise back to You.

     Bm       D        G                   Asus4-A7
    Holy, holy, holy is the Lord.
                 D                  G/D
    Hallelujah, hallelujah,
             A7/D  D
        hallelu-jah!
               D                   G/D
    Hallelujah, hallelujah,
               A7/D  D
