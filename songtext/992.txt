1.	Lord, I have come to worship You
                        A                            E
	With the offering of my life.

	I give it to You,
                                               B
	And, Lord, You can do
                 A                                      B
	With me whatever You choose.

Chorus:
                       A                E                  B
	To Your altar, O God, I will go;
                                 C#m                     A
	I choose that place as my abode
                                  E
	‘Cause I am Yours,
                                B
	Jesus, I am Yours.
                       A                 E                 B
	To Your altar, O God, I will go,
                                C#m                        A
	And there I’ll worship You alone;
                                      E – C#m
	For You are my joy
                            B            E
	And, Jesus, I am Yours.

2.	Lord, in my heart,
	Dwell and be blessed
	As I live to give You rest.
	My only desire
	Is that	You’d be pleased
	With this life You’ve given to me.

3.	Love is the cord binding my life
	To this place of sacrifice.
	Your will is the altar where I lay;
	Forever here I’ll stay.
