1.    My faithful Father,
D/F#-   E/G#         A
    Enduring Friend,
                                Bm
    Your tender mercy's
                   E/G#               - D/F#
    Like a river with no end.
         E/G#     Asus4     A
    It overwhelms  me,
D/F#-    E/G#        A
    Covers my sin;
                              Bm
    Each time I come
                             E/G#
        into Your presence
                         D/F#                  Esus4-E
    I stand in wonder once again.

Chorus:
                   A                    D        A/C#
    Your grace still amazes me;
                  E                          D   E-A
    Your love is still a mystery.
               A/C#            D    E    F#m
    Each day I fall on my knees
                                 D
    'Cause Your grace
               Esus4-E    F#m
    Still amazes    me.
                   D              Esus4-E
    Your grace still
                         A(For Bridge: D)
        amazes me.

2.    O patient Savior,
    You make me whole;
    You are the Author
    And the Healer of my soul.
    What can I give You?
    Lord, what can I say?
    I know there's no way
    To repay Youâ€”
    Only to offer You my praise.

Bridge:
  D-                   A/C#-
    It's deeper,       it's wider,
  D-                      A/C#-
    It's stronger,       it's higher
                 Bm                   Esus4          E
    Than anything my eyes can see.
